It wasn't a "rebellion". The Métis were not "insurgents". They never were subjects of the British Crown, no one "rebels" against something they have never been a part of to begin with. They were free human beings living on their own land as the Creator / creation intended. Their ancestors (up to seven generations before them) had once been engagés (laborers with short term contracts) of the french, but the french (who only had monopoly trading rights in Indigenous territories) had long since returned to europe. I emphasize they were (are) free human beings. They never were slaves of the french and the people could never have been transferred to another "owner" when they never had been owned to begin with. Not that owning slaves was ever moral or acceptable, human beings are not property.

Also, it would appear that Tetley will no longer be sold at the Bath Hotel. I will have a look at the link on Gettothepub.com later to see if Thornbridge have mentioned any specifics. Am not a Tetley fan, but I think you'd have to go back many decades to find an era when Tetley hasn't been sold. This seems a shame, and if it turns out that's what happens, then it suggests a lack of knowledge about the job of running the Bath by its new incumbents.

Obama will have to decide soon how many American troops to withdraw this summer in keeping with his promise to begin in July to wind down the surge of reinforcements he ordered in late 2009. The Washington Post's Rajiv Chandrasekaran has reported that Obama's civilian aides are pushing for a deadline of fall 2012 for the withdrawal of all of the 30,000 troops he sent. Why fall 2012? Even most Afghans realize the date has nothing to do with their country.

As we can see, the Conservatives, Liberals and especially the Bloc Quebecois have an overall negative party brand, as the negative terms about them outweigh the positive ones. The Greens and especially the NDP have overall positive party brands. Things becomes particularly good for the NDP and particularly bad for the Liberals and Bloc Quebecois when one makes the same calculation yet treats the subjective terms as entirely positive or negative.

In real life, Sutherland has a better grip on the digits at hand: 12 million viewers watched the Touch preview that aired in January. The series, created by Tim Kring, the writer and producer behind Heroes, launches for real with a global media event on March 18 — a date that figures prominently in Touch's opening episode. The premiere re-airs that week in more than 100 countries around the globe and on March 22 in the United States. The wait-and-see preview combined with a worldwide rollout makes it an unprecedented launch for TV. "I'm feeling nervous," Sutherland says, lighting a cigarette. "There's a lot riding on this, and I know what it means to have a hit show, certainly."

During seven days of testimony and argument, it was clear that Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Deborah Russell had little more than inference and innuendo - "circumstantial evidence," in the parlance of the courtroom - to indicate elements the state must prove to win a conviction.

The Olloclip is clever as a mongoose. In your hand, you can easily mistake it for a tiny monocular. It looks like a pair of lenses pointed in opposite directions and separated by a narrow gap. Click the Olloclip onto a corner of your iPhone (for best results, choose the corner with the camera lens in it) and the Olloclip holds on securely. One side of the Olloclip is a wide-angle lens which doubles the iPhone's natural field of view. To shoot fisheye images, pull the Olloclip off and flip it around.

Because you passed when I was at school, there are days that I wish I was home schooled. I didn't find out that you died until around 8:30 that night. I had a really bad day at school and was looking forward to telling you all about it when I got home from Girl Scouts, even if you couldn't talk or would get long, soft hair all over me. I still love you; you were the best dog in town, even if you would chase cars around the block and not come home for about an hour because you loved the neighbors.
It is true that Commonwealth Act No. 671 does not expressly say that the President is authorized to promulgates rules and regulations until the date of the adjournment of the next regular session of the National Assembly or Congress as the above-quoted Commonwealth Acts; but it is also true that it clearly provides that “pursuant to the provisions of Article VI, section 26, of the Constitution, the President is hereby authorized, during the existence of the emergency, to promulgate such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out the national policy declared”; and that the definite and specific emergency therein referred to is no other that the “state of total emergency as a result of war involving the Philippines”, declared in the title of said Act No. 671, that was the reason for which the President was “authorize to promulgate rules and regulations to meet resulting emergency.” It is obvious that what Act No. 671 calls “total emergency” was the invasion and occupation of the Philippines by the enemy or Japanese forces which, at the time of the passage and approval of said Act, had already landed in Philippine soil and was expected to paralyze the functioning of the Congress during the invasion and enemy occupation of the Philippines.

Igor's home had been booked all summer since he begain listing it online. I understood why. Affordable lodging was nearly impossible to find here, and at less than $100 a night, it was a steal.

The next morning, he brought us coffee and pastries that we expected to pay for, but he didn't charge us. The bus stop was a short walk from Igor's house.

It's fine to have a few things in your wardrobe that you reserve only for non-work use. As a rule though, I think it's best not to keep too many of them, because for most of us, reserving clothes only for 'special' occasions means they don't get worn enough to make them worth owning. They take up closet space, they're often expensive, and they taunt you day after day with their loveliness while you go schlumping out in your boring black dress slacks and sensible shoes.

Story blurb: River Thieves is a beautifully written and compelling novel that breathes life into the pivotal events which shaped relations between the Beothuk Indians of Newfoundland and European settlers. Following a series of expeditions made under the order of the British Crown, the reader witnesses the tragic fallout from these missions as the Beothuk vanish and the web of secrets guarded by the settlers slowly begin to unravel …Told in elegant sensual prose this is an enthralling historical novel of great passion and suspense, driven by the extraordinary cast of characters. And with it Michael Crummey establishes himself as one of Canada’s most exciting new talents.

Almost every night (between Midnight -2:00AM) they have sleep overs. Families, including children come out of their cars and they flock to the house. Sometimes they have bags of food, sleeping bags, or ice chest and they knock and they are let in and then they disappear. I always peek and try to see what goes on behind their doors. Before the type of people that would be members were hippie types with mullets but today's members look more mainstream. Scary.

One may ask, How can something be inside and outside at the same time? Parīkṣit therefore names a prominent Vedic deity: Vāyu, god of the sky. Everything in our world is within the sky, but that does not mean that the sky is limited and contained within everything. The sky is distinct from and greater than everything within it! Similarly All-Attractive Hari is the soul within everyone and everything, yet is an individual person as well, greater than and distinct from everyone else.

For instance, we don’t identify with “captives”, because we only envision captives as those who are behind bars in a prison or prisoners of war in a prison camp. We think we are free but, spiritually, we are really in bondage to the emotional and psychological trauma brought on through the circumstances of our lives and our sin nature that keeps us in captivity.
“Listen Sally,” Peter said standing up from his bed, “I understand how you feel about me being away but it’s funny how you seem to really enjoy the fat bonus checks I bring back home after these trips. If you do have a problem with this arrangement you can always be replaced, I’ve done it before.”

It struck me Saturday morning as I was driving the final hour into Royal Oak, Michigan that it was only about 10 miles from downtown Detroit. Unfortunately, I had a slight queasy moment in my stomach thinking what am I doing here. Detroit is known for a mass exodus of people that has been going on for years, and the stark contrast of the city against the skyline wasn't doing my thoughts of this place any favors.

I also welcomed a little simplicity into my life. Yes, you can do anything you do with a Mac on a PC… but to accomplish this, you may end up doing more tinkering on the PC side. I tinker with PCs all day at work. That’s already my bread and butter. When I come home, something that “just works” or “works easily” is a great relief.

Quick cut to Romance of Black Grief, again with the giant farting bass of death leading the ballad. Mizutani sounds like he is playing through an AM/FM clock radio behind the overwhelming bass on this track. Mizutani is thankfully in tune and making up for the bass dominance, singing sweetly - until it cuts off in the middle of the verse. I guess our 50 minutes were up . . .

I’ve been an admirer of DeLillo’s for a while, but never before have I been sucked into his world so completely as I did while reading Libra. More focused than the sprawling Underworld (though it does contain that breathtaking prologue) and less zany than White Noise (indeed, this book is as airtight and humorless as they come), this fictionalized account of the Kennedy assassination is a taut, frighteningly plausible re-imagining of the event that “broke the back of the American century.” And it seems to me that it’s the perfect representation of everything DeLillo is about.

Favorite Chocolate: I feel that salty foods and chocolate make a great pairing, which is one of the reasons I enjoy bacon & chocolate. While in Portland, Oregon, I found the Xocolatl de David Chocolate Bar with Parmigiano Reggiano, and this was an excellent combination, the saltiness of the cheeses working well with the sweet chocolate. I can easily see other similar cheeses working well too with chocolate.

To my shock and horror, Annika suddenly knocked on Kuya’s door, then she ran away, leaving me behind. Kuya opened the door, and he saw me standing there. Bakit ka kumakatok? he said, irritated. I was like, hindi ako yon, si Annika! Si Annika! Unconvinced, he closed the door. He became more and more unconvinced as this thing kept happening again and again— Annika knocking on the door, Annika running away, and Kuya finding me outside his door with the same I-didn’t-do-it defense.

The purpose for which the Muslims are required to fight is not as one might think to compel the unbelievers into embracing Islam. Rather their purpose is to put an end to the sovereignty and supremacy of the unbelievers so that the latter are unable to rule over men. The authority to rule should only be vested in those who follow the true faith; unbelievers who do not follow this true faith should live in a state of subordination…Jizyah symbolizes the submission of the unbelievers to the suzerainty of Islam. To pay the jizyah of their own hands “humbled” refers to payment in a state of submission. “Humbled” also reinforces the idea that the believers, rather than the unbelievers, should be the rulers in performance of their duty as God’s vicegerents.

How about this Americans, for a way out of the b.s. that is urban life now. Try a MASSIVE ‘Cattle Drive Trail (Highway)’ winding through the entire USA several time. Look at any herdsmen in the ’3rd World’. They do not have issues with lack of food though living in tents and being constantly on the move . . . in fact pay the herdsmen in meat and perhaps land for subsistence farming – how about 1 acre for every 5 years of herding work (lots of younger men would be self sufficient in as soon as 5 years instead of having 100,000s in debt on compound interest – no education but subsistence farming is far better than being hoodlums and gang bangers etc.) and animal husbandry work including food and board sound fair? Better than the homeless food stamp culture dotted with criminals and prison culture paid for by the tax payer. Look at Libya’s Green Mountain Project, plenty of young people who do not need any education or education debt to be part of that and to at least be able to grow their own food. It’s just that simple.

If Cuyahoga County is going to prosper, local governments need to become more efficient. FitzGerald understands that. He shows it by asking the business community for help retooling county operations and by meeting with Jackson and Gov.-elect John Kasich to discuss regional cooperation. It's time for other leaders to show the same spirit of change.
Although it didn't occur to me during preparation, one bite and I realized this is really just a beefed up (er, tofu-ed up?) version of borscht - heartier and chunkier, but very similar in terms of the broth. The roasted parsnip and turnip were my favorites - so tender and sweet from roasting. The occasional pop of the fresh ginger helped give a bright note to an otherwise rich soup, and I might add more next time. I also recommend cutting the shallots into smaller pieces in between roasting and transferring to the Dutch oven for simmering - come serving time, they were a bit hard to eat off a soup spoon. A touch too much black pepper.

Former L.A.

In California, addiction counselors are split on the legalization issue largely because of their long-standing support of treatment over jail and legal penalties for marijuana addicts. Yet nationally, public health experts mostly are against legalization.

He’s pompous like Naoki, but he doesn’t actually have the skills to back it up considering he’s not that bright. Instead of being cold and disinterested, he ‘s loud, violent, and teases Tsukushi like a child. Unlike other male tsunderes, who rarely let their motivations show, Tsukasa’s childish goofiness makes him transparent, thus hurting his ‘cool’ factor. But it’s because of his childishness that he and Tsukushi feel like equals despite the fact that he’s rich and powerful – and that they’re both quick to anger, and stubborn. Unlike most other male tsunderes in shojo manga, Tsukasa has no problem telling Tsukushi he loves her once he figures out his feelings for her, and is willing to give up everything to be with her. So rather than being mysterious, Tsukasa is obvious and overt, which makes him both hard to handle and hard to resist. All of the contradictions in Tsukasa’s character – that he’s violent yet gentle, arrogant yet selfless – ultimately make him not only unique, but very lovable.

Notebook: Wisconsin running back Montee Ball is coming back for his senior season. Ball told reporters that NFL evaluators informed him he likely would be a third-round draft pick, and he thinks he can improve his stock. The Heisman Trophy finalist scored 39 touchdowns this season, tying Barry Sanders' NCAA record. He finished the year with 1,923 yards rushing and 2,229 all-purpose yards. ... Georgia Tech wide receiver Stephen Hill is bypassing his senior season to enter the draft. He caught 28 passes for 820 yards, leading FBS players with an average of 29.3 yards per catch. ... Oklahoma quarterback Landry Jones decided to return for his senior year, saying: "There is still a lot more to do." ... South Carolina cornerback Stephon Gilmore and receiver Alshon Jeffery are giving up their final seasons to go pro. ... Southeastern Conference commissioner Mike Slive says he expects "meaningful discussions about possible changes to the BCS" in the coming months, including about making it a four-team playoff. He pushed for the so-called "plus-one model" in 2008, but it didn't have enough support among the other commissioners.
Last night, CBS aired episode 3.22 of The Good Wife. Entitled ‘The Dream Team’ and serving as this season’s season finale, the episode featured two of my favorite guest stars on the show, Martha Plimpton as Patti Nyholm and Michael J. Fox as Alicia’s most formidable opponent, Louis Canning. I am going on the record right now to say that The Good Wife has the BEST guest stars on television (Matthew Perry, Mamie Gummer, Carrie Preston, to name a few), but Michael J. Fox is my all time favorite. When he shows up, you know it’s going to be a great, dramatic episode, and this episode was no exception. Mr. Canning and Ms. Nyholm did, in fact, show up to stir things up with an evil plan to destroy Lockhart & Gardner! In the end, it was all a distraction so that the ‘dream team’ could poach Lockhart & Gardner’s biggest client.

Joined in the cleanup by his brother Yngve, a graphic designer whose control only serves to heighten the manner in which Karl Ove has been sideswiped by his father's death, we watch Knausgaard stumble through the filth and detritus, weeping uncontrollably, trying to piece together exactly what had happened in the years of his father's self-imposed exile. One extraordinary realisation is that his father had actually spoken of suicide several times; his belief that statistics didn't show that many car accidents with single drivers were deliberate attempts to end a life, his thoughts on the various methods; but all of this had seemed nothing more than a topic of conversation, Knausgaard unable to see it as anything else, his father having imprinted his image of himself so clearly in Karl Ove's mind that he was 'always engaging with the person he had been' rather than the one he had become.

Again, you gotta play it LOUD. Tell me the outro, that delayed arpeggio stuff at the end (is that right? Arpeggio?), when the chord resolves back down at the very end…. tell me you don’t want that running over the end of the trailer of your movie when it fades to the title screen followed by the COMING NEXT SUMMER screen.

It is easy to criticise China, but much of the criticism doesn’t take into account the historical context of their development, and the urgent requirement for economic growth as a precondition for social justice and progress. Nor do the critics acknowledge the degree to which the Communist Party of China is self-aware of the difficulties and negative aspects of Chinese society – but there are often no easy answers to solve problems overnight.

If the sound of a favorite song fills you with glee, you are right -- music can help you heal, make you happy and get you going. In the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Mike's home base) and New York-Presbyterian (Dr. Oz's), patients enjoy live music to help with recovery and reduce pain. Music even can help fight off a cold or aid in cancer treatment.

Jack Box has been one of my most devoted readers for almost as long as drinkdrank has been kicking. He regularly comments on posts and I can honestly say: Jack loves beer. Jack loves beer so much, he took my idea to compare canned versus bottled beer, and ran with it. In fact, I'd say he ran with it like Forrest freakin' Gump. Jack took the initiative and selected a number of canned and bottled beers; employed his own "interactive sippy tests"; and then reported back the results! I think we've found drinkdrank's first contributing editor. Although I use the term "editor" loosely, because—as I'm sure you've come to realize—there is very little editing being done here.
At first I thought the kitchen stumbled when the ricotta-filled ravioli ($17) came out looking dry, covered with breadcrumbs and equally dry slices of sauteed artichoke. Yet, one bite and I realized the dish scored big time. The pasta was glazed in a thin layer of butter that made the ingredients adhere, and the creamy filling was enough "sauce" for the dish.

Need I remind you, not so long ago, there wasn’t a championship game matching up the no. 1 and no. 2 ranked teams (In the 56 years before the BCS, the nation’s top two teams met in a bowl game eight times). Often, a no. 1 or 2 ranked team just had to beat a team ranked somewhere between no. 5-10 in their bowl game to be crowned national champion. For all the negativity the BCS gets, it has done a better job in crowning a consensus national champ than the system before (i.e. Georgia Tech claiming a portion of the National Championship in 1990 after winning the… Citrus Bowl?). Yes, I like to pick on Georgia Tech.

A. Well, luckily they were both Ford vehicles. When we close the books on August, we will set an all-time sales record for Fusion, Flex and the highest sales on F-150 trucks since October 2006. Clearly for the rest of the year, we will see a slower sales pace than we have seen the past four to six weeks. We expect this year the industry will sell between 10.5 million and 11 million units, still down from last year, and about 12.5 million next year.

I get immediately hooked with the two-note piano combo that repeats itself along with handclaps that makes it sound like it could be the start to a RJD2 or DJ Shadow number (I was convinced the beginning was identical to RJD2′s Final Frontier, but there’s only a passing resemblance). I also like that the first thing that gets added to that piano and handclaps is Follin’s voice, which is both sweet and strong. So you get sixteen seconds of pure pop bliss. Not that what follows isn’t beautiful too as they layer on more organs, drums, guitars that fit perfectly with the melancholy lyrics about running away and never coming back as “those bad things always keep coming” for her.

He said this action was justified under the Handschu consent decree, which stems from a 1971 lawsuit by political activists in New York who’d been subjected to NYPD surveillance. The lawsuit was resolved in the 1980s by a federal judge who instituted a set of binding guidelines on the NYPD’s surveillance of political groups. The guidelines were updated in 2003 after the NYPD claimed the decree inhibited their ability to counter terrorist attacks.

The problem is magnified Arkham City, because in order to not repeat the pacing of the first game, the player is forced to do battle with foes armed to the teeth before even hitting the halfway mark. This throws a major wrench into the sequel’s balance. Why? Simply put, you’re not as threatened. You learn to deal with “gunners” much sooner with your fists, and as such, the need for the stealth mechanic evaporates. And while you can argue the designers did try to add some other wrinkles to keep you in the shadows, they don’t work as well. Take hostages as an example: many sequences have the enemies taking hostages, warning that if you come close they’ll shoot. However, they’re not an effective threat because you can punch out every enemy in the room, and as long as you just creep up on the guy holding the innocent, you’ll be okay. In addition, while one could argue that you can approach many of the open-world aspects in a stealthy manner, the pre-scripted levels/indoor sequences very much emphasize combat over stealth, which would make it a deliberate design decision to diminish it.

It is my perception that water scarcity in west Punjab and the changing Russian stance towards Afghanistan and Central Asia will open up the way for Pak-China defense pact coinciding with the rise and revival of Islamic insurgency in Kashmir. The prospects of Kashmir future are bleak and dreary indeed! The downing of a NATO Helicopter with thirty eight U.S special operation group by Taliban using Rocket fire shows direct involvement of both Russia and China in arming Talibans. In the back drop of this intense hugger-mugger, India fully well knowing, the internal situation in Pakistan, that shows, that at present Pakistan is severely caught in the coils of a ferocious turbulence, the genesis of which stems from the demands for re-organization of States in Pakistan on ethnic and linguistic considerations. India is also aware that the overwidening hiatus between Pushtoons and Mahajirs in Karachi, has become unbridgeable, as three hundred people were killed in this blighted city in the deadliest month of July 2011 still invited Hina Rabbani Khar the young Foreign Minister of Pakistan for intense parleys.

Now, reduced to a cold apartment, robbed of the dream and throwing away his child hood toys and his precious cardboard boxes becuase he didn’t have the room to keep them around. Gutted.

"Top Gun" is a film that, like many others, has never received the video game treatment it deserves. To be an American alive after 1986 is to have experienced, even if briefly, the chest-puffing, high-fiving jingoistic bravado that only an F-14 piloting Tom Cruise can deliver.

Wait, I lied - I do have one more special comment regarding this recipe. Gina's version below calls for 93% lean beef; I used 99% fat free turkey.

McLaughlin also testified in favor of the bill at a committee hearing as counsel to an industry coalition, the Building Owners and Managers Association.
Basic human psychology is that people hate being forced to do something. They really hate it. But when they think they’re doing it themselves they’ll embrace doing that thing that they hated only a minute ago and go even a step further. Think about the American Revolution, we started a war on a 2 cent tax on per metric ton of a breakfast beverage because it was forced on us but when it was our own representatives doing it, hell, let’s tax everything to death! (A little hyperbolic, I’ll admit, but I think you get the point). People are stubborn by nature, but Americans especially have a “bet me” attitude. Another example, when was alcohol consumption highest? When it was illegal. To this day when does the alcohol intake for most people drop radically? The day after they turn 21…when it’s no longer a chance to stick it to the man, it loses a little something.

Meanwhile, Republicans have drawn a line in the sand, at least when it comes to a seat on the Court of Appeals. Should the Republicans take back the White House in 2012, the Democrats will have little choice but to reciprocate with this new interpretation of "extraordinary circumstances." That will result in an increasingly short-staffed judiciary that lacks the services of highly qualified individuals who had the misfortune of ever having an opinion, or even an appearance of one.

It's struggling, which makes it such an attractive place."

Whilst fully approving the decision to refuse the registration, the reasons therefore are fairly interesting to read. The pertinent case-law says that the trademark registration should be refused if the trademark is suitable for offending the sense of morality of a considerable part of the public. The senate argues that the public perception does not depend on the perception of the majority in a calculatory sense. Rather, the act of registering the trademark would increase the fraction of the public feeling disturbed by the trademark.

10. Love. To receive love is to have given love. Love begins with kindness, a choice. Take out your neighbors garbage. Mow their lawn. Invite them over for dinner. Kiss your spouse when you wake up in the morning. Change a dirty diaper. Hire a maid as a surprise, or clean the house yourself. Choose to respond with empathy when you have none. Say the hard word when it matters and you must. Take your children out on dates. Surprise your parents with a visit. Come home early from work. If someone notices something of yours they think is special or amazing or of note, give it to them. Listen to the stories of others. Ask questions about someone else’ life. And of course, though often missed, have compassion on yourself. All love of God and neighbor flows from a love of self.

But it would be a serious mistake to imagine that personal performance is what matters in combat. Combat is not a contest between individuals, like poker or tennis; it is a team event whose success depends on group cooperation and morale. So the behavior that concerns us is not individual achievement but the social dynamics of relationships and groups. The issue is whether and how the presence of openly declared homosexuals in the ranks affects the solidarity of the unit.

Though less overtly Thrashy than ‘Power Of The Damager’, this album sounds like Tommy Victor doing what he likes best without paying too much attention to what crowd he should please most with the material.

2. Back in Beantown: Meanwhile, as the Thunder win their way into the playoffs, Perkins' and Robinson's former team has lost three of its last four games and have gone from battling Chicago for the No. 1 spot in the Eastern Conference to trying to stave off Miami for the second seed.

There were several babies that crawled over to where I was standing, reaching up to me. I quickly grabbed two of them, one for each arm. A few minutes later, one of the Ugandan women that worked there yelled at me. “No! Put them down!” Confused and hurt, I promptly set them back down on the ground. Screaming and crying they looked up at me, again reaching up, wanting to be held. It was an awful feeling and I began to cry with them. I was able to hold myself together and choke back most of the tears but I felt so helpless. Later, one of the women told me that they don’t want the babies to rely on being held. So, I did as the “mamas” were doing and sat down on the ground. My lap was then swarmed like the beach at Normandy. I tried to interact with them by rubbing their backs and holding their hands. One of them fell asleep in my lap and the same happened to my husband. (Melting again.) We kept exchanging awkward looks. Like “what the hell are we supposed to be doing right now?” Believe me, I’m used to chaos. I think I mentioned that I have something like 9 nieces and nephews just on my side, but this was different. I felt so overwhelmed.

BROADVIEW HEIGHTS Local concerned residents and anti-fracking activists traveled from Broadview Heights to Columbus Sept. 21 to join the Rally for Ohio’s Energy Future outside the Ohio State University Student Union building. The rally coincided with Governor John Kasich’s Summit on Ohio’s Energy and Economy.
(1) Compensation for landlords. Landlords and their associated supports, eg banks and property agents, are being disadvantaged because contracts agreed on an open market basis are being intruded upon and changed in a way which will reduce the value of the landlord’s asset. All to assist the economy and ensure we are a competitive country. So might there be some way in which this mandated sacrifice might be compensated? I think there is, but it won’t unfortunately be an upfront lump-sum because the State can’t afford that. But on an ongoing basis, the State can act to reduce certain taxes or levies which would provide landlords with a share of the increased national wealth generated by having a more competitive factor of production. It was interesting to hear yesterday that NAMA apparently lobbied the Department of Finance in May 2010 on this issue. I wonder how such an approach today would be viewed through the prism of the NAMA Code of Practice on the conduct of NAMA officers which forbids lobbying of the sort set out under section 221 of the NAMA Act – on a strict reading of the Act, NAMA would probably be okay but would this sort of lobbying be contrary to the spirit of the Act?

Now, this is no knock on Anger; he's likely to be really good. It's just that the Jaguars went 5-11 last year and have plenty of needs to fill. Defensive line was a much greater need than punter.

It was bound to happen. In shows like "The Pied Pipers of the Lower East Side" and "Happy in the Poorhouse," the Amoralists delivered a high-octane, cartoonishly manic twist on 1970s Hollywood grit and early Sam Shepard. Now the Lesser America company emulates the older troupe with its debut show, "Squealer" -- a kinship underlined by the presence in the cast of Amoralist stalwarts Sarah Lemp and Nick Lawson.

For men are not, like women, bullied and nagged by the great houses of Parisian couture. They have no tradition and no accepted standards to guide them. At the most, the tailor’s sheets may let fall a hint or two from time to time; under the sketch of a man in canvas trousers, rope sandals, striped jacket reaching to knee and straw boater draped with constrasting scarf, for example, we may find these words of restrained advice: ‘a sailing holiday along the Breton coast calls for the appropriate outfit.’ A friendly suggestion, no more: should the holiday-maker prefer to set sail in pleated shorts and jumper with a border-pattern of shrimps or lighthouses, no eyebrows will be raised. And it is precisely this freedom which gives to the male costumes their freshness and excitement: while none can foresee how they will finally appear, few, once they catch sight of them, would allow a single item to be changed.
Can we define ourselves by our thoughts and emotions? Ask yourself if you think about and see the world the same way you did twenty years ago. Have your per­ceptions changed? Have your beliefs changed? Have your motivations changed? Has your knowledge changed? Your thoughts, beliefs, and emotions change from moment to moment, year to year, and decade to decade, yet you are still you. We can’t therefore say that the true self is defined by our thoughts, beliefs, or emotions.

From the bay, glance toward the bluff on your right and you'll see Princeville, where Matt and his daughters stay during their trip to Kauai. No need to tread lightly here. This vast, manicured resort hotel, shopping center, condo development and golf club epitomizes what happened throughout the Hawaiian islands when the descendants of missionaries, sailors and the native royal families they married into realized that the tourist trade could be an even more lucrative way to exploit their ancestral lands than sugar cane and other island crops. It's what Matt's cousins have in mind for the 25,000 acres they have inherited.

Nutritional bounty. Due to the harsh environment in which they grow, sea vegetables produce interesting bioactive compounds, according to a 2011 review of almost 100 scientific studies in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Peptides derived from sea vegetables appear to have blood-pressure-lowering effects. A study published in the August 2011 Nutrition Journal revealed that regular seaweed intake among Japanese children was linked with a reduction in blood pressure.

Like the bust area, toes are generally seen as an erotic zone (toe cleavage anyone?), and the peep toe on a shoe is like a low-cut blouse that exposes cleavage. "There seems to be a lot of circumstantial evidence that people think of feet as a smaller version of the body," says Valerie Steele, director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "The term 'toe cleavage' is related to breasts, and peep toe, as its name indicates, is like a type of peep show - a way of exposing part of yourself."

I had my 26th high school reunion last weekend. What a riot that was! We had a pretty good turnout--107 people out of a class of about 200, and only a few of them were spouses! It was great to see people I haven't seen since we graduated, and some since our 10-year reunion. It was also quite interesting to find out that a BUNCH of people are local and I NEVER see them around town! What's up with that? I suppose it's because the only place you would actually SEE anyone in my small town is if you happen to catch them at the town hub: Stewart's. LOL. This place needs a pub. For real. Oh well. I've got a lot more Facebook buddies now, and hopefully we can expand the circle for the next reunion five years from now. I'm thinking we'll have to make it a weekend event, so that we have more time to visit with each other. I figured out that I only had about 3 minutes to spend with each person last Saturday. And I KNOW I didn't get to talk to everybody! *Sigh*

Even being a candidate for shamanhood would make injuries such as his quite common. For Mesdan– formerly Danni– such a thing was to be a matter of course.

My cookies were a bit of an adventure, and almost a complete failure! I was close to tears on the Friday before the party, thinking I was going to go to Wegmans and buy 5 dozen cookies. Thankfully I gave it another shot on Saturday (day of the party) and found my error. A 1/2 cup of butter is ONE stick NOT two. I don't know what I was thinking? I ended up with 40 useless, cranberry orange shortbread cookies. It was a definite face-palm moment, which ended with a lot of flour on my face...

That said, I still have two veteran receivers in Eric Dungy and Daryle Hawkins. If speedy redshirt freshman Devon Blackmon could at least run go routes, wheels, posts and tunnel screens, I should be able to get production on the outside when Team Moseley stacks up against the run, which would be a must.

Nobody was considering a 12-win season when the Browns lost two of their first three games in 1986. They had been 8-8 in 1985, with veteran Gary Danielson the starting quarterback until an injury pushed rookie Bernie Kosar of Youngstown Boardman High School into the job. That team won the championship in a remarkably weak AFC Central Division. Then, in a first-round playoff game at Miami, the Browns took a 21-3 lead before losing, 24-21.

I worked out alot this past year, but the scales didn't reflect lower numbers. I did, however, lose a couple of inches, but not enough to change my clothes size. I have also observed that I am an emotional eater. Now since confession is good for the soul, I hope acknowledging that fact will help me to watch it.

The surgery was a success. In his third year at DU, Babb made his college debut in the Pioneers' Feb. 17 season opener against Ohio State. He has started all 11 games for 10th-ranked DU, which is 7-4.

Best modern ballpark: PNC Park, Pittsburgh. Small is beautiful. With seating for a bit fewer than 39,000 in two tiers plus outfield seating, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates is a modern treasure. The industrial heritage of the city is seen in the steel truss work and limestone bricks. It sits beside the Allegheny River with views of the skyscrapers of the city's Golden Triangle across the way. The team is terrible year in and year out, which for the tourist is a good thing – ticket prices are among the lowest in baseball, and you can usually walk up and get a good seat.

Hiba Abdullat, Abed Arslan and Sarah Sharif, exhibited photography. Faces of people made a rather interesting subject, the positioning and showcasing of the photos played a role, as in the case of Sarah Sharif, whose photos all collided to form an integral artistic unit.

Coming back to flying kites on Independence Day, you know flying kites symbolizes the spirit of freedom, a spirit of free India. But, do you think we really are independent? Being a part of a political discussion, I was really ashamed to see that most of the people (and I mean people from all ages, including those who have witnessed the freedom struggle, too) acknowledged that India was better when there was British Rule than what is prevailing here today. Now, this is a point of real chagrin for all of us, for this means all those who struggled so hard only to make their next generations see a free country, all those who lost their lives in the struggle, was in vain? Are we so insentient that we don’t even canonize their sacrificed lives? And then we are happy digging our faces into the air and symbolizing the spirit of freedom when what we are suffering from is worse than British Rule!
that'd definitely work too!

F. Frederic Fouad, an '80 Hershey graduate and a 2009-10 visiting scholar at Harvard Law School who focuses on child-care issues, said Springboard shouldn't have been approved by the controlling board in the first place. His biggest concern was the dorms, which he considered unsafe for students and which broke with Hershey's tradition of family-style group homes.
The latest on my knee is that, from what I told the GP about the pain, intensity, where it is (the pain, not the knee) and how long it was there (again, pain. Really?) he seems to think it’s probably a structural problem. Straight away he said he’d like to refer me to a specialist and suggested that I refrain from running until I’ve had it looked at. So he gave me two options; wait til mid-March and see someone through NHS, or go private. Normally I’d opt for NHS all the way, but in these circumstances, if I had to wait until March then that’s my marathon place out the window right there. So I should hopefully have my appointment in the next week or so and they will be able to tell me whether or not I will be able to run, and obviously the severity of the injury.

In March, computer science Professor Brian Barsky was checking changes to the state budget when he noticed a subtle difference that could, he believed, allow public money to flow to UC baseball, gymnastics, rugby and other cash-strapped teams, at the expense of academics. "Without any discussion, explanation, or publicity, the time-honored prohibition on using state funds for intercollegiate athletics at UC disappeared from the state budget," Barsky said.
They ran a race and someone won and seven others lost. That’s how it works. Some win more than others, but all can lose. Shock and surprised? No I’m not. But then my memory is a lot longer than some others. Frankly it’s good for the sport. I’ve said all year that the sport needs rivalries and that we need to tout more than one or two athletes. Bolt v Gay can be exciting for the sport – especially when there is a question as to what the outcome might be. Predictability leads to boredom – and that’s the last thing this sport needs. We need excitement. Look at how much discussion this one race has elicited! Imagine what four or five races/events like this a week could do for track and field.

MR. DAVIS: Yes, we could export it. But the challenge is, we don't have the capital to make the run because it's a different voltage system, it's 220 versus 120 here. And so we need money in order to grow into the European market, but the European Union is 500 million people compared to 300 million here in the U.S. So that little bit of capital would help us grow.

The film opens with Blomkvist's conviction on charges of libeling Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg), a billionaire financier. This threatens the future of Millennium, the magazine he runs with his sometime lover Erika Berger (Robin Wright). Then Blomkvist gets an offer out of the blue from Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), an industrialist whose family helped build modern Sweden: He wants Blomkvist to live on the island his family has inhabited for generations and write a history of the clan and its industries.

"The lack of transparency undermines the credibility of the application process," said David Sciarra, executive director of the Newark-based school advocacy group, the Education Law Center.

On average 600,000 bottles of Absolut are produced every day in Åhus. Most Absolut bottles are made in Limmared not far from Åhus, but production also takes place in France. All bottles are manually checked and then rinsed with Absolut. After washing, the bottle is filled with the scheduled variety of Absolut. The same bottling machine is used for all flavours and is washed automatically between flavours. The bottling machines can fill up to 240 bottles per minute. After capping, the bottle is sealed, the modern seal replacing the seals of former times. The seal is now made of plastic, which is heated and “shrunk” on to the bottle and the cap. The most intricate part of the whole bottling process is fixing the medallion showing “the King of Vodka” L.O. Smith on to the bottle. This must not vary by more than 0.5 mm. The bottle is positioned correctly with the aid of marks on the glass, and then the medallion is attached. Apart from the medallion, there is also a back label and in certain cases an importer’s label on the bottle.

What makes the show unique is its sly, silly humor. Just after executing an amazingly rigorous acrobatic routine with a bunch of chairs, performer Florian Zumkehr is suddenly called upon to sing a gentle ballad on a guitar. Valerie Benoit-Charbonneau, the sole female and self-proclaimed "flirtatious" member of the group, attempts to read a book while physically battling an uncooperative recliner. At one point, the ensemble bursts into a graceful skateboard ballet to the accompaniment of "It's Only a Paper Moon."
A law enforcement officer recently complimented me for being a teacher. He shared that he couldn’t understand how high school teachers put up with those little darlings day in and day out and that given his experience with some of today’s youth he respected my endurance. I responded that high school kids were really a lot of fun to spend time with, and that most of the students I taught were very well behaved in my classroom. I suggested that the individual cases that he interacted with were in fact the exception.

The music and media conference and festival takes place March 12-16 and is headquartered at the Austin Convention Center downtown. Most industry officials purchase badges months in advance, but walk-ups are welcome. The walk-up rate for the music portion of the convention (badges are also available for the film and interactive conferences) is $650 and theoretically gets you in to all SXSW music and media-related events. However, past experience has shown that even if you have a badge, you're not necessarily guaranteed admission to especially popular events. Capacity means capacity—and even the biggest of venues here reach it—so if there's an act you're dying to see, plan ahead and show up early.

A great technique for getting a kid to talk is to MOVE. Children, especially boys, can have a hard time expressing their feelings if they feel like an adult is standing there, waiting for an answer, and “pressuring” them to say something. If you can remove the child from the situation and go for a walk (ideally outdoors), the questions you ask may elicit more than the standard, “I dunno” answers.

Another baby food annoyance? I can't find organic prunes, plums, or dried plums anywhere either, so I have been buying jarred prunes. Target was out of 2 brands of organic prunes on Saturday (so I am clearly not the only food conscious mom noticing the fresh shortage whose baby needs prunes to crap effectively now that he's on food besides just breastmilk), so I picked up the Gerber brand (Gerber- never touch that processed stuff), and the organic food line is FULL of added garbage. I ended up with some Gerber conventional prunes (GASP!) because the only ingredients are prunes and water. Moral: don't buy Gerber organic.

You can tell almost immediately that Harber (who also penned the Eddie Romero-directed flick The Kidnappers and an episode of "Hawaii 5-0") had a copy of "Island Of Lost Souls" sitting by his typewriter as he knocked out this script. After all, when you have an island, an evil and/or mad scientist, experiments shrouded in secrecy and an unseen monster, there's every indication that you're not watching an original work. Yes, this is a story that has been done time and again, and would be done even more times than here (shall we flash-forward to 1977 and 1996, anyone? No? Wise choice.) and this isn't even the worst example of this retelling. At least they do us the honor of not giving us a title like H.G. Wells' Terror Is A Man or a subtitle like Terror Is A Man: Island Of Lost Souls. Points for integrity, guys.

After this he is joined by the other ministers in front of the altar, and after a brief moment they all bow toward the altar. While this is happening the congregation sings the final hymn. The ministers of the liturgy, minus the Book of the Gospels, now exit the church. The congregation should remain in their places until the end of the closing hymn.

So, why this blog, you ask? Well, as I slowed down to handwrite some letters, I drifted into a very contemplative space. Lately, I’ve been working a lot on personal growth, and trying to figure out who I am after having gone through some pretty major life changes. Writing a letter afforded me that space. Unfortunately, those carefully penned letters went unanswered. Maybe it wasn’t such an unfortunate thing; I’m beginning to see the act of writing was reward enough itself.
Perversely - but rather predictably - some of the most useful starting points for learning about the inadequacies of the system come not British sources, but from New Zealand and the United States. This report here, for instance, gives a good overview. Originally "confidential", it has now been declassified, and even the fairly anodyne language makes it clear how hugely inadequate the system was.

What Galileo had actually done by pointing his telescopes to the sky, discovering craters on the Moon, the moons of Jupiter and sunspots, was to put an end to the classical belief that the heavens are perfect and unchanging and that only the Earth is subject to change. He had also defended the theory of Copernicus, now long dead, a theory that was not even his own but one which he endorsed because he believed it to be true.

One of the things that amazes me like nothing else living in South Florida is the rate of change. A hundred years ago almost exactly, this entire area was accessible only by boat.

For book publishers, the relevant market isn’t readers (direct sales are few), but booksellers, and Amazon has firm control of bookselling’s online future as it works to undermine bookselling’s remaining brick-and-mortar infrastructure. Amazon controls every growing segment of the industry: online physical books, downloadable audio books, online used books, and e-books. Amazon commands about 75% of the online market for print books, and 60% of the e-book market (a percentage that decreased from Amazon’s reported 90% two years ago, as a result of agency pricing).

On my part, I’ve seen photos of Keith with other guests. One pose was even similar to one picture we had together. I laughed when I saw it. My reactions was probably like that because I don’t have feelings for Keith. I like Keith inside Earthling as my regular, yes. I find him attractive, yes. But I don’t want him exclusively. And I have no complaints if he does whatever with his other guests. My only concern is that he makes me enjoy my time with him when I pick him in Earthling. I admit it probably would be different if I liked Keith the way Jess likes Ramon. The green eyed monster may have gotten me too then.

If you have been reading my blog you know that I have spent the past week at a series of writing workshops and presentations. My mind has been totally consumed with all things writing. Early this morning I was lost in the meditative state that often occurs before I am ready to admit that I am awake. Since I started writing I have discovered that my body reacts to this time of day differently than it did in the past. I may be aware of what is going on in the house, but my mind will be exploring a vast array of other possibilities. My body simply does not get up. I stay there, mentally transported where ever my mental agenda has taken me.

Munch muscle-protecting protein. How much protein do you need? Simply multiply your weight in pounds by 0.4. If you're 165 pounds, that's about 66 grams of protein. Get yours from fish (32 grams of protein in 4 ounces of salmon or trout), skinless poultry and plants (kidney beans, nuts and edamame have 16 to 18 grams of protein per cup). With vegetarian protein, you also get fiber, protective plant phytochemicals -- and no saturated fat.

After much thought of the story, I still find myself stuck with its images lingering at the back of my mind, mainly at loss for words on how to describe how impactful it was – as if it was uncanningly real, as if reminding me how I was then drifting and falling within the depths of the story.

In short, all together everyone:
I’m sure you’ve been hearing about and reading about health foods everywhere you turn. After just a few weeks in the US for the summer, I was saturated with “eat this, not that!” advice in the newspaper, magazines and on TV. If I actually listened to every one of them, I’d be eating… well, nothing, since even the health experts seem to contradict themselves most of the time. While a raw food diet is actually less of a diet and more of a lifestyle choice and it’s certainly not for everyone, gradually integrating more and more raw foods into one’s diet is absolutely a healthy choice for everyone. In his book, Graham makes raw food seem less a chore and more a creative and delicious way to get your greens. The book is divided into five parts that give you the basics of going raw, a step-by-step guide to getting started, several recipes, how raw food can be medicinal and nutritious then how to maintain the detox at home on your own. Graham goes into the scientific explanations of why raw is better, but, unlike many raw guides, doesn’t judge his readers. If you’re licking your lips from your cheeseburger and fries while perusing the pages, Graham would be happy you’re even listening instead of lecturing you on why the dead cow in your stomach is the end of the world. Plus, the recipes don’t use very esoteric, hard-to-find ingredients or require hard labor and specialized technology. So many raw recipes list hundreds of ingredients and require soaking, sprouting, dehydrating and crazy dancing (not really, but my poor attempts at them have resulted in such). Graham’s recipes are all simple, yet flavorful and offer alternatives if you don’t happen to have certain ingredients on hand, which I always like in a cookbook. Or, if you do decide to go all raw, Graham makes sure to include a chapter on “Raw food detox and social challenges” and how to remain raw despite pressures from society, family and friends. Graham also outlines a sample 15-day plan to have an idea of how to incorporate the recipes into a daily meal plan and make sure you’re getting enough calories throughout the day, not often easy with raw foods. Plus, the recipe names are all very creative and witty such as his “Portobello Bella Bella,” “G-Man’s Coconut Soup,” “Monkey King” smoothie, “Virgin Mary” juice or “Broccoli Rawdorf Salad.” This is more than just a cookbook and it’s a timeless book than can be consulted anytime – whether for a quick raw recipe idea or daily health tips.
Still trying to figure out y I bought 72 army men for $2 at Target. War anyone?
The best books are those written without these signs. Though that is extremely hard to accomplish, it can be done. The same idea is behind my feeling about these signs as is behind my feelings about book teasers and spoilers (read this post for more information): I want to be surprised. And what is more surprising: a person jumping out of you from behind a solid partition in a chicken costume, or someone slowly approaching you in full daylight wearing bright pink? (If you weren’t expecting anyone to come along in bright pink, perhaps you’d say the second option, but for the purpose of this post we’ll just go with the first.) That’s right, the walking poultry is much more surprising. So if you saw that person in bright pink slowly ambling toward you, admiring the scenery and giving you altogether too much time to examine him, would he surprise you if he reached you and calmly said, “Boo”? That’s almost what the author is attempting when he or she tries to surprise a veteran reader, unless the author is really good at his or her job (which you ought to hope he or she is, or else you’ll be pretty disappointed in the book).

Maloney added: "The fact that Sherrod Brown can only muster 43 percent of the vote in a state where his name has appeared on ballots for thirty-eight years, proves that he's clearly out of touch with Ohio voters."

And yet, to be fair: May was rustic, wasn't he? An old-world amiability and ease were at the core of his appeal. As the show points out, May played many roles in his life, including salesman, developer and daredevil pilot, "but the role he perfected was that of an 'old Californian,' a man of the West, free and easy in his living, relaxed and without social pretension."
SA's Minister of Rural Development and Land Affairs Gugile Nkwinti warned on March 2 2010 at a press conference that 90% of all the 'redistributed farms' were unproductive, with 5,9-million hectares of these formerly white-owned, productive farms laying idle, its once so modern, well-developed, multi-billion Rand infrastructures stripped and vandalised by looters. He blamed the entire problem on 'foreign-land ownership' however – threatening to crack down hard, saying:

In September 1983, Thompson was a sergeant with 12 years on the job at the Fort Myers Police Department when he was suspended indefinitely after an internal affairs investigation. He was accused of swindling the U.S. government out of at least $4,400 for security patrols he didn't work at a federally funded housing project, according to (Fort Myers) News-Press articles.
A second problem was that the governor used the expected free lunch to justify putting only $7.3 billion of the $10 billion in bond proceeds into the pension fund. The remaining $2.7 billion went to pay bond interest and to cover part of the state’s required pension contributions in 2003 and 2004 -- freeing up money to spend on other initiatives, including an aggressive expansion of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. This meant that when you added together the unfunded liability and the outstanding balance on the bonds, the plan widened Illinois’s overall funding gap for pension benefits.

For the potatoes: Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to boil. Drop in potatoes, and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, and cool slightly. Cut each potato in half, and scoop out center with a melon baller or small measuring spoon, leaving only a 1/8 to 1/4-inch shell. Cut a bit of the bottom off each potato, so they will stand up on a plate.

Newcomer ended up at Elon (N.C.) University, where he was a roster junior last year but did not play.

Sweet with just a hint of an edge, The Selection is a puzzle that initially feels familiar, the individual pieces all ones we’ve seen before in other stories, but yet Ms. Cass manages to guide our hands through a beautifully and artfully executed assembly where the familiarity quickly fades to a non-issue in the face a truly enjoyable tale. While there is certainly a level of predictability stemming from the presence of the aforementioned easily recognizable plot elements, Ms. Cass quickly reminds us why such elements are so popular, drawing us swiftly into America’s tale when a forbidden love is immediately put to the test as circumstance, opportunity, and pride force the taking of irreversible first steps toward a new fate.

Loving-kindness is a core ethical virtue, but it is not easily translated into English. We just celebrated Passover and at the close of the seder, we recite the Great Hallel, Psalm 136. We read it responsively with the leader reading the first line and everyone responding, “For His steadfast love endures forever!” In those verses, steadfast love is translated from the word “chesed.” We could even read that as “His chesed is always there.” And as you read through Psalm 136, it starts off with: “Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever.”

At 1:04 p.m. Monday, CBS Radio Chicago's WJMK-FM (104.3) will switch to featuring classic hits from the 1960s, ‘70's and ‘80s that management believes will improve the station's ratings. The new format, to be known as "K-Hits," replaces the adult hits format the station called Jack-FM in place since 2005. There were no hosts to take requests, so listeners heard only what the station chose, mainly hits from the 1960s through the 1990s.

There's nothing inherently unsafe about having the cart much further away from the rear of the dog as long as the traces are snug. The problems you get when the shafts are too long and the cart is too far away is that it is difficult to maneuver, and the turning radius is much wider. The shorter the shafts, the easier it is to turn. However, if the shafts are too short or the dog was placed too far back (move the brakes forward to fix), then the dog's foot or hock would hit the bottom side of the cart.
So boom. There we go with that. Maybe I am an idiot for being friends with someone like this.

Should the agreement be broken, for example by one party not providing the service in the agreed manner or period of time, a bright blue mark appears in the palm of the violator. This not only shows they have broken a commitment but allows them to be easily tracked by the spell Locate Spittle Bound and makes other divinations about the breacher easier as well.

That means I can reduce the wear and tear on my car, reduce my spending on gas, and change my car insurance to pleasure (no, not that kind of pleasure! just means I don't drive it to work. not sure why they have to charge a different rate for that... but who am I to question the gov't monopoly on auto insurance in this province?).

Two days later at practice, James openly disagreed with how his head coach handled the situation. Ilgauskas steamed and said nothing. Brown said he was sorry and refused to discuss any demand Ilgauskas may have made, accepting the entire blame. In the next game, a home victory against the Phoenix Suns, Ilgauskas did break the record, and he did it while leading the Cavs with 14 points. When he came in the game, he received a standing ovation and nearly cried on the spot. But he asked not to be recognized and refused to take questions from reporters afterward.

But something has to be said in the defense of Noah. There is a discussion about how to understand the sentence “Noah was a righteous man, perfect in his generations…”[2] Rashi tells about the two opinions on how to understand this, that either it is to be understood that he, Noah, seemed as a Tzaddiq, compared to his generation (which was full of wickedness), but in other generations, especially next to the greater Tzaddiqim, would seem ordinary in his observance, or that since he was a Tzaddiq in his generations, full of wickedness and temptations, how much more would he have been a greater Tzaddiq, had he lived in better generations.

Since I'm currently in a situation where I'm out only to my wife, my normal dress is more or less androgynous - women's Levi's, a T-shirt of some sort, girl sneakers, girl undergarments. I work at home, so sometimes I'll switch to a more feminine blouse, but because my kids often drop by without much, if any, warning, that's the extent of my getting dolled up lately. But I was sort of ok with that. I'm on my hormones, feeling basically femme most of the time, though sort of in a princess-locked-in-a-tower sort of way. It isn't ideal, but I felt like it was ok enough.

Sometimes, I hope that's exactly what they'll do.
- I stopped reading “A Game of Thrones” even more recently. Seriously, there’s two more books still to come out?! I refuse to make this another Harry Potter experience where I have to reread everything just before the next one is published so I can remember what happens. Ugh, the problems of being literate.
You work in a hospital or other medical facility.
Back to reality, we have a President who has made the central focus of his re-election campaign…and his administration, for that matter…the division of the American people along economic lines. He’s hoping to parlay this frightening, yet sad tactic, into another four years. Our friends at the Economic Collapse take aim at Mr. Obama’s plans….

The first time a prof introduced that concept, my brain basically exploded. I've never been the same. (Thankfully.)

I can imagine the brewers scrambling to fire up their brewing equipment to meet that first pent up demand; it must have been electric! I can also imagine what those first few batches of legal beer probably tasted like as so many breweries rapidly converted from making root beer, malted milk and spark plug parts to churning out cheap beer to sate the masses. I imagine a lot of it sucked.
Olive oil and seasoning
Yes, brunch and a movie--The Avengers!
Now, let’s talk about that second point. What are we showing non-christians and our kids if we go around worrying all the time. Look, I know I am not perfect and there are times when I sincerely have to pray to God to take the worry from me. It may go something like this: ” God, I can’t handle this without you. You are going to have to take this problem and the worry that I know I am going to keep having and take it from me. I can’t even give it to you — just take it.” You know what? He has every time. I have all the faith in the universe in my Father in Heaven. And, amazingly enough, the more times I cry out to Him to take anxiety, pain and worry from me, He does. Don’t whatever your outward display of worry and what others see in it. It can be a big deal. Someone who doesn’t know Christ may wonder how you can get through tough situations without losing it when others can’t hold it together. I am not saying I don’t wear my emotions on my sleeve, but I am trying to get better.

About 950 participants are expected in this weekend's Cleveland Triathlon, the 25th anniversary of one of the first big-city triathlons in the United States. The Cleveland Triathlon has hosted some of the top professionals, been the site of U.S. championships and a world championship, injected innovative racing techniques into the sport, lost its big-ticket sponsor and now is climbing its way back from several lean years.

I've always said all my books have a shape, and OUTLANDER's internal geometry consists of three slightly overlapping triangles. The apex of each triangle is one of the three emotional climaxes of the book: 1) when Claire makes her wrenching choice at the stones, 2) when she saves Jamie from Wentworth, and 3) when she saves his soul at the Abbey. It would still be a _good_ story, if I'd had only 1 and 2--but (see above), the Rule of Three. A story that goes one, two, _three_ has a lot more impact than just a one-two punch.

On the bridge of the Cap Beatrice, the AIS tracking system stopped transmitting the ship’s position shortly after 5 a.m. By law, virtually all deep-draft vessels (ships of 300 tons or more) are required to continually report their location when transiting international waters, except where the ship’s security is endangered. In these rare cases the nearest vessel-tracking service must be notified. Traffic monitoring is required by international law, mostly as a way for large ships to avoid hitting each other. AIS is a line-of-sight signal, and reception on land depends in large part on the height of the antenna.
Thanks for the mention!

It seems like yesterday that "The King's Speech" and Colin Firth's stammering King George VI were taking movie fans by storm. What a difference a year makes. "W.E." portrays George and his wife, Elizabeth, not as heroes but as henpecked and scheming. Conceived and directed by Madonna, "W.E." saves its sympathy for George's brother, King Edward VIII, who famously abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Wallis and Edward are the heroes and title characters of "W.E." The DVD and Blu-ray (Anchor Bay, $30-$40) include a making-of featurette. -WASHINGTON POST

It was January 2012. I hadn’t made any resolutions. I was just going with my wife to what I thought was a “smoothie place” because she had bought a Groupon months ago that was about to expire. I got the smoothie… and so much more.
It was Tuesday, July 6th. We had a nice relaxing day of doing not much of anything. Amber and I had been out at the pool with my nephews, Blake (10), Greggory (7), Tucker (22mo), and Emma. Amber had to be to church in a bit, so she headed in to get ready, took Tucker with her. I stayed outside so that Blake, Greggory, and Emma could swim for a few more minutes. A huge horsefly decided to start bothering the kids, so they all wanted to get out of the pool and go in side. Blake and Greggory grabbed towels and dried off a bit, I wrapped Emma up in a towel (arms tucked in) then told the kids to head inside while I cleaned up our things.

We have stolen too many inheritances, mortgaged too many futures, and, in recent weeks, stripped too many children of the security of peanut butter. Rage is appropriate.
As for you, dear reader, I'll have to leave you with the same cliff-hanger, the resolution of which should appear on this page next week. As I begin my second foray into the joyously surreal, deliriously sleep-deprived world of motherhood, I'll keep up with the news, weighing in with the occasional Tweet and Facebook post. And I'll look forward to returning to the column in a few months.
In the last days of the campaign, Mr. Samaras has appealed to Greeks to give him an outright majority. He has bluntly warned that a coalition with Pasok would be unworkable and would tie his hands in reforming the country.

Dumbarton Oaks (the gardens are amazing), Tudor House (take the tour--it is great), Montrose Park that connects to Rock Creek Park of NCIS fame, Oak Hill Cemetery, Evermay Manor (not open to the public), Dumbarton House (worth seeing and different from Dumbarton Oaks), Mt Zion Church (first African American Church in DC) and Cemetery, Jackie Kennedy's house after leaving the White house, Martin's Tavern (there is a toy store across the street that I ducked into for about 10 minutes while it rained. Then it quit and I was on my way), old street car tracks that haven't been torn up, St. John's Episcopal Church (first picture at top--this is where Thomas Jefferson worshipped when he was in DC), the Kennedy's house that they were living in when he was elected president, a couple of nice kids with a lemonade stand (not in the guidebook but definitely worth the stop and $.50), Georgetown University, the steps from the movie The Exorcist (picture 2), Francis Scott Key bridge and park, Dean and Deluca fine deli and store, Georgetown Park shopping complex that used to be a tobacco barn, the towpath for the C&O Canal, Thomas Jefferson Street which isn't all that impressive, Washington Harbor, and the Old Stone House (picture 3). Whew! Could all of that have been in just one 3 mile area including walking from one to the other? I didn't stop at many of these places for any longer than it took to take a picture, and it took me about 4 hours. Did I mention it was about 95 degrees?

In thinking of Outsider greats, Darger and Finster quickly come to mind, but in the same breath I hope you would add Bill Traylor. Traylor’s work consists of a singular strength in vision that is both direct and precise. His images are simply stated and purposeful in mark. The use of modest materials and cardboard backing speaks to the function of the images he made, and whether it was the strength of a bull or the bark of a wild dog, Traylor’s work spoke with a voice that was true to the essence of what he was depicting. Admittedly I have had a soft spot for Traylor’s work since the first time I saw it, so it is easy for me to highly recommend dropping by the High to check out this work as well as the other shows before they fold up shop and make way for some new exhibitions, which will be any day now ( April 29th to be exact on the Picasso to Warhol show).

The way that FAR is used in MENA is a relic of the discredited modernist theory of ‘towers in the park’ – which undermined the concept of planning for streets. But the MENA region got towers but not parks, it got streets, but not ones that were usable or walkable. The voids that FAR was supposed to create were designed to increase sunlight and skylight, but in the intense heat they are the very things that should be minimized. FAR is supposed to match development volumes to transport and other infrastructure, but in MENA FAR has been increased ‘to the sky’ with limited public transport system. FAR, as used in MENA, is a dysfunctional, discredited and inappropriate tool producing perverse outcomes, it is a recipe for congestion and visual chaos.

Please note the word “willing” in my list of requirements. A man’s effort is worth a lot. If he tries and fails it’s up to you to decide how important that requirement is to you. I came up with this list AFTER being honest about myself about what I am able to give to my partner. This list has helped me avoid HUGE wastes of my time. I will not work harder for someone than they are willing to work for me… point, blank, period. Sometimes writing down what you want/need to be happy and secure in a relationship gives you the strength you need to walk away or work it out.

The closest thing to a dhampir in D&D is the Half-Vampire template, which is still a little bit annoying because of level adjustment things. D&D is rife with templates.

Paizo did the Dhampir race, a much less powerful version of the Half-Vampire, so that you can play them from the get-go.

Floor-to-ceiling windows look out on the dark sea and the glinting lights of the pier. The crowd is prosperous-looking and much more dressed up than the diners at nearby M.B. Post. You see suits and ties, Italian sport jackets, designer dresses and major bags. They're here for the action, and loving the idea of not having to drive to the city for a taste of upscale night life.

He’s ready to pick the lock to her apartment door and camp in her living room if that’s what it takes.

"The Scream" that is up for sale is the third and most vibrantly colored of four versions the Norwegian artist made between 1893 and 1910. It's the only one not already in either the National Gallery in Oslo or that city's Munch Museum. Although conceived when Munch was living in Berlin, Oslo is where the image's icy fjord, undulating landscape, bleeding sky and visually raked bridge -- a favorite local spot for suicide, like the span over San Francisco's Golden Gate -- are located. All four versions are on board, not canvas. Besides the pastel, two of the other paintings were made with tempera and the remaining one was made with crayon.

We finished off our wine, had a few laughs and headed around the corner to the club. When we arrived the tension with our male friends was palpable, almost to the point of hilarious. Rayanne and I had brought dates to the club before, but never as a team and this seemed to upset the pack order somehow. Nothing was ever said out loud, but the guy comedians were starting to act weird. My date went to the bathroom and Niko stepped up to me, “That’s what you consider a date?” he said. “The guy’s a toothpick. I didn’t know you liked pipe-cleaner-dudes.”
You didn't miss anything. General assessment from several people was "a few good booths but overall it was repetitive & bland."

I’m no paid editor (yet), but I edit essays, e-mails, and whatever else my peers send my way. Whether my comments are digital or hand-written, there are many. People tend to think this means they are terrible writers. They also assume whatever it is, it is the worst I’ve ever read.
Julian Maclaren-Ross’ Collected Memoirs are a master-class in autobiographical writing. His recollections strike an off-beat chord, shifting between dolefulness, mirth, vulgarity and the genuinely outré. Published in a beautiful moss-coloured paperback by Black Spring Press, the book showcases Maclaren-Ross’ talent as a great wit, and a man of intellect and erudition. Often remembered as a Fitzrovian gadabout, a fine raconteur and a literary mendicant, Maclaren-Ross remains an esoteric figure, revered among a select number of fellow writers but largely forgotten by the reading public. His Collected Memoirs are full of experience; his childhood in the south of France, wartime army barracks, down-and-out boarding houses and subfusc sordid little pubs scattered around the midnight metropolis of London. As with much of his fiction, Maclaren-Ross uses informal, colloquial language to convey his life in all its fascinating detail. This use of a demotic vocabulary constitutes a literary style, redolent of cigarette smoke and drink, which is entirely his own. Booze was a lifelong crutch in Maclaren-Ross’ life, so much so that he seemed unable to face the world without it. Accordingly, he could usually be found holding court in one of the many infamous saloons in the nub of Soho, partaking in the revelry that has come to define his work.
The bill will be considered by the Senate Transportation Committee.
Let’s be honest here, even the title gives itself away; it’s not called The Thing Begins or Before the Thing or Again with the Thing. It’s The Thing. It’s as though The Thing took John Carpenter’s The Thing and assimilated it like the characters it’s about, but there’s just something intrinsically Not Right about it. To put it in the parlance of the film, it’s imitating and it can’t help it when a big mouth bursts through its chest when the viewer starts to think: “Hey, wait a minute...”

Marquette, which had 29 shots on Gregson for the game, came out quickly in the second half with four premium scoring chances. Three of the shots -- by Nick Korte, Nick Schranck and Pat Dwyer -- all went over the top of the goal, while Gregson had to make a good save on Schranck.

The person to watch throughout the run is Freeman. Less than two weeks after stepping into the role because an illness to the original actor, his Al has hints of what could be. Freeman's facial expressions, which wisely stop just shy of mugging, and an adept tremor during climactic scenes foreshadow a nuanced performance down the road. It's all very subtle, which is how the best burger should be.

I'd been wanting to do a fun work-wear post for a while now, so when I was approached by SNOBSWAP, I decided it was the right time. Some of you don't hold office jobs with strict dress codes, so you have a lot more creative leeway when it comes to how you dress during your work week. (Note that if you fall into this category, I will automatically stew silently at you from a distance). A lot of you, however, have to trek to the office, to the courtroom (ESQ's?), to boardrooms, and through corporate America's meetings, all the while, looking professional and polished...hopefully.
In short, Muslims will simply be doing more of what they are doing already, and trying to do it more consistently and with greater and more permanent effect. Far more worthy of detailed analysis is the likely nature of the violence of the British paramilitaries which have not yet emerged and whose activities are therefore, at present, the great unknowns ahead of us. The only obvious precedent we have in this regard is the loyalist terrorism we have already glanced at. During the Troubles, there were two paramilitary ‘teams’: republican paramilitaries (most obviously the PIRA, but also the OIRA, INLA, etc.), whose aims were to bring an end to British rule in NI and bring about a united Ireland of whatever sort, and loyalist paramilitaries (most obviously the UDA and UVF), whose aims were to keep NI in the United Kingdom and maintain Protestant political dominance there.

And this second thing you do. You cover the Lord's altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. But you say, "Why does he not?" Because the Lord was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth. 16 "For the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the Lord, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the Lord of hosts. So guard yourselves in your

Why do we want it good all the time, why do we get angry at God when he doesn’t do stuff the way we expected him to. We’re like Israel, when they were fed daily by the miracle of manna they complained and whined. They wanted the strong flavours of Egypt. Israel’s shopping list to Moses was all the smelly, strong tasting foods: fish, cucumbers, melons (cantaloupe was popular in Egypt and the Egyptian cucumber is particularly sweet and welcome in the heat), leeks and garlic. ‘We don’t want manna,’ they basically clamored, ‘we want the good stuff.’ This is all in Numbers 11, get a Bible out if you want.

She smiled to herself for a moment, still feeling the tempo of the ditty, enjoying the rhyme scheme. The poem went on, she knew, to talk about the hideous maids from Ugaboo, the blue-skinned girls from The Vinkus, the towering tree women from The Glikkus and the swamp things from the Quaddling Country, incidentally the very land that Elphaba's father had come from - or she'd thought, until she'd learned it was in fact the Wizard of Oz who had sired the little green monster, which completely explained why her sister, later to be known as the Wicked Witch of the East, had been such a different creature, even lovely by some standards. Not Gillikin standards. Neither of the girls had had the proper upbringing, poor wretches that they were. It was no wonder they had done so well though - they literally towered over the Munchkins, who she was sure must have look upon them as gods.

The Cape Dutch or the Afrikaner in the Cape. They have never ever had a struggle for freedom for independence. Never. It was the Boers that had it. And the Boers came & started the Boer Republics. They lived there peacefully. When the war came - the Anglo-Boer War. Thousands of people in the Cape - the Cape Dutch helped the British against the Boers. So they were our enemy. We can not stand with our enemy & call them together. They are our enemy tomorrow. They say: "you can't really fight this you can't really do that." you know. We got to make up our minds & decide we want to do this we want to go & do that we want our country back. We can not let them negotiate you know. We can't let them negotiate for us because we will loose. We will loose everything. It's a very difficult situation. To take back South Africa is totally ludicrous in today's world. If a third world war breaks out then by all means nobody will have a chance against the Boers because nobody in Europe or America will lift a finger of whatever we do down here because they will be fighting each other shooting with atomic weapons & you name it. They will not have a minute - they will not have a second to worry about what's happening in the rest of Africa. But at the moment everybody talking about retaking the whole of South Africa they are nuts. Like the HNP. The Herstigte National Party. They're nuts. There's a saying going around amongst some of the right wing people in Southern Africa. The only time the Boer Nation really will be saved is when those that are trying or those leaders - or those who believe they are leaders who are trying to save us today are actually dead. Only then will we be able to be saved. We will get rid of all of these old ideas & old stigmas then the Boer Nation will sit up say wow let's rethink everything. That's where I am coming from.

After doing graduate studies at Princeton, Cowan continued his nuclear research as part of the top-secret Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb.

The first thing you want to do after you fill your pond is get some sort of a filter and pump system to keep your pond clear. This can be a very intricate system or a simple one (like I have). There are many different pumps and filters to choose from and they can be very expensive. The first thing you need to think about is how many gallons your pond is and how high your waterfall is. You need something that is going to pump all the water through the filter at least once per hour and have enough power to push the water up through the waterfall.
Although even China took an economic hit in 2008 and 2009, the pace of growth here is astounding.

Woo Jin learns that Dae Su and Mi Do have left her apartment and that she quit her job. Mi Do reveals that she's in love with Dae Su and they finally make love. Woo Jin tells his bodyguard that he's getting depressed and that they'll leave when this is done. At Dae Su's new place we see gas coming in under the door. Men in gas masks enter while they're out and leave a gift wrapped box on the table containing Mr. Park's hand, which Dae Su had threatened to chop off. This tells Dae Su that Woo Jin is listening to them. Mi-Do investigates "evergreen" and discovers the phrase "evergreen old boys" a term for attendees of Dae Su's high school. Mi Do and Dae Su visit the school and find Woo Jin's picture, as well as the fact that in the same class a girl, Soo Ah, has had her pictures cut out of the yearbook. Dae Su calls Joo Hwan to ask about this and he tells Dae Su that Soo Ah died after Dae Su transferred out of the school. Describing her, Joo hwan says that she apparently committed suicide, jumping off a bridge and that "She was a total slut. On the outside she acted just like a prude, a good girl, inside she was really wild. Rumors had it that slut fucked everyone at school! I should have gotten a piece of her." Joo-Hwan doesn't realize that Woo jin is in the internet cafe with him, eavesdropping. Enraged at what he's hearing, he kills Joo-hwan. He then gets on the call with Dae Su and tells him "My sister wasn't a slut!'

A Reiki treatment is a very relaxed affair. You may either lie on a couch or, if this is not possible, you can receive Reiki sitting in a chair. No clothing needs to be removed to have a Reiki treatment, the healing energy is able to pass through anything, even plaster casts! The practitioner places their hands either non-intrusively on the recipient in a sequence of positions covering the whole body, or may even give Reiki without actually touching the body at all. A full treatment will take between 1 - 1½ hours. A Reiki treatment is concerned with treating the whole person rather than specific symptoms. Reiki can be used to help heal at any level of being: physical, mental, emotional or spiritual. Reiki healing can be given anywhere, at any time, as no special equipment is needed. The practitioner is a channel which the energy is drawn through by the need or imbalance in the recipient. Neither person has to use any effort of will or concentration during this process.

Today I took 0.2 kilos from yesterday (which made me gain 1 pound back) even if I was on goal yesterday. It’s probably because I didn’t drink enough yesterday or because of the episode with the birthday cake. It’s ok after all I asked for it and I can deal with it, I just have to keep on goal and exercise. The gain doesn’t matter because I was good yesterday, today too and I feel more positive about the whole weight loss situation. Going for a walk released some of my “looking for a new house stress” and I feel more relax than a few days ago.

Can anyone see the sense in this? Take a series of everyman pocket paperbacks like The Fontana Book Of Great Ghost Stories, which, in their day were available in just about every newsagent and supermarket up and down the country, and like as not got several people on here reading the stuff. Make a random selection from volumes 17-20. Get Les Edwards to design you a terrific cover, fully in sympathy with the original series. Now, have the thing printed, making sure it’s as unnecessarily bulky as possible, and run off just enough copies so that it sells out prior to publication. Appealing to the “I’ve still got my factory sealed, never been opened, worth a bomb!” non-reading market is all very well, but it’s also driving another stake into the heart of what’s supposed to be ‘popular fiction’. Hope they won an award for it.

** Brodus Clay's match with Jack Swagger was more than a squash, so I appreciate that. But now it seems Clay is in a holding pattern facing Ziggler and Swagger, and I wonder what they payoff to this angle will be. The worrisome thing is that Ziggler is becoming pigeon-holed into a supporting role because of his amazing ability to sell. Look at the way Ziggler took Clay's headbutt; you would have thought someone shot him.

In the regular season, it's first team to score wins, unless a full quarter is played with no score. Then the game is a tie.
But the NHLs commitment to limit concussions is either full time, as it has been for the past few seasons and most of this one, or its not. The league knows the difference, but it also knows that pandemonium on the ice is a lot easier for plenty of viewers to follow than a puck. Sold-out arenas and through-the-roof TV ratings across the board, including towns like Phoenix  whose Coyotes may well be playing in another city next season  are a testament to that.

Cannarozzo, a 44-year-old mother of two, can attest to that. Her nightmare Thanksgiving in 2000 had all the telltale signs of poor scheduling. She was trying to make a dinner deadline of 5 p.m. because that's when her in-laws like to eat.

Before we give any money to derivatives issuers like AIG, we should find out what their obligations are, including which of them are to counterparties with "insurable interests" and which are to speculators.

Road #2 was bumpy! And we put the truck through her paces with some 4WDing, sand bogs, ditches, and tight turns. Then all of a sudden we ended up at the coast. We still had no idea where the mob were that we were headed out to see and had to call in and ask for directions at the first camp we came to. A bit further along found a green water tank and a heap of banana trees…. Near enough! so we stopped for a chat and to find out where we were supposed to be. The view from the huts along the water was just amazing. It would be a totally different life but to just live out there on the edge of the bay would be incredible.

Weekly collections should return, but they must be properly funded. This does not mean a return to throwing all waste in the green bin, as limited landfill capacity is a problem, so we must retain and improve our recyclables kerbside collections. It is also important to continue to encourage residents to recycle wherever possible. I would also like to see kerbside collections extended to include plastics in Amber Valley.

Harry Haynes, the son of former leading jump jockey and BHA starter Peter Haynes, was born on March 23, 1989 and took out an amateurs’ licence in 2005. He had his first winner at Goodwood on the Flat in August of that year aboard Mythical Charm. He rode his first jump winner aboard Solway Sunset at Aintree on May 18, 2007, in a mares’ handicap hurdle. That marked the beginning of a good season for Haynes, as he partnered a further 10 winners at a strike rate of 15 per cent before making the decision to take out a conditionals’ licence in 2008. Haynes learnt his trade riding out for trainer John Bridger in Hampshire at weekends and during school holidays, whilst also riding in Arab races for Tony and Sue Brunton and Georgina Ward. He also had 30 rides in point-to-points when he was 17. This is where his relationship with Scottish handler James Ewart started, picking up a spare ride after Ewart’s jockey broke a collarbone. After four years attached to Nicky Richards’ stable in Cumbria, he was appointed stable jockey to Ewart before the 2009/10 season after riding six winners from 12 rides for the yard the season before. After a successful three-season spell with Ewart, Haynes began this campaign with Yorkshire- based trainer Malcolm Jefferson which has yielded some big races successes already. The 23-year-old steered stable stalwart According To Pete to big races successes in Wetherby’s Rowland Meyrick Chase and Haydock Park’s Peter Marsh Chase. Haynes realised a lifelong dream this season when riding Attaglance to victory in this year’s Martin Pipe Conditional Jockey’s Handicap Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival – his first at The Festival. John Smith’s Grand National record: No previous rides

Here's how this image came to be associated with a Boy Scout troop in Milwaukee (what a long strange trip it's been...) One of the kids belonging to Troop 11 took a vacation trip to south Texas and while there noticed and photographed a road sign with this image on it. He and several of his fellow Troop 11 Scouts decided this would make a great patch for their 'patrol'. (Here's a quickie Boy Scout primer for you: a troop is made up of 20-60 boys, and each troop is divided into individual 'patrols' of 5-9 kids. The kids in each 'patrol' name their own group and create a patch to signify themselves.)

His eyebrows furrowed, "Heather?" No response. "Heather, you know I was just joking." No response. Mark felt a pang in his stomach. Instinctively he held the dart gun in his right hand as his left slowly pulled the pistol on his hip out of its holster. Mark swallowed hard, licked his lips and tried one more time, "Heather, turn around, please." His side arm was already pointed at what he thought was his wife's head, but instead of her beautiful face, he saw the stretched, black skin, and bulging eyes of a Rasling, framed in a wig made to look like Heather's hair. The Rasling flashed a quick grin, and Mark loosed two shots that ruined the couches Heather picked out a couple of months before.

Some of the original unfinished works were well known, others obscure. Bruce Adolphe was assigned a piece representing both, Franz Schubert's projected 12th String Quartet, the first movement of which is the often-played C Minor Quartettsatz, the second a little-known fragment of a second movement. His lively response set the theme from the latter in irregular rhythm and earthy harmonies reminiscent of Béla Bartók.

He finished with fouls in Game 4 and just six points and seven rebounds in nearly 30 minutes. Contrast that to his 14-point, 20-rebound outing in Game 6 when he said he just played and stopped thinking about whistles, and the production is like night and day. ."

Add the brown sugar to the saucepan, give the mixture a few stirs, cover, and turn the heat to medium-low (it’s important to begin slowly so the rhubarb warms up and begins to release its liquid). Cook the rhubarb for about 15 minutes, covered, until the mixture is saucy. Remove the cover and increase the heat to medium. Cook for 15-17 minutes, stirring continuously, until the rhubarb is completely broken down and thick enough that a spoon leaves a trail at the bottom of the pan.

The Minnesota Vikings at No. 3 are supposedly locked on Matt Kalil, a left tackle from Southern California. Kalil is considered a premium prospect, to be sure, and the Vikings could use him for the next 10 years. But Kalil, largely because of his position, can be bypassed at the right price. Put it this way: Teams who might want to trade up to No. 3 this year don't have Kalil in mind.

Montero is expected to become a middle-of-the-order power hitter – exactly what the Mariners need. These types of players don’t come around very often, and the Mariners took the opportunity to grab one with six years of team control before free agency.

Not only is it exasperating for those of us who know the quality of some of the work being shown in regional Britain, despite the frequent malaise in the media. With critics often treating the regions as ‘other’, like some colony whose attempts at culture must be picked over anthropologically by the ‘educated outsider’. I think it also unveils something deeper and darker about our media: its lack of understanding of the Britain outside London and the narrow talent pool it so often draws its staff from. Perhaps the BBC move to Salford will shift this a little. We live in hope.

For many of us living in the city, our most intimate contact with nature is seeing how birds find places to nest as if the urban landscape were their forest. In "My Baby Blue Jays" (Viking: $16.99, ages 5-8), John Berendt, author of the (adult) bestseller "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," turns his captivating storytelling powers to the family of bluejays that took up residence outside his New York apartment window. He began photographing them when the blue jay and his wife (no scientific terms in this book!) bring in their first scrap of nesting material, and followed their offspring until they stepped out on their own ("As he fell, he fluttered his wings frantically. Not enough to fly, just enough to slow his fall a little"). His patient observation shows how close a novelist's eye can be to Jane Goodall's scientific rigor.

-Joseph had a vision that he would be a great leader and that many would bow down to him (birth). Joseph’s brothers sold him to some merchants and he became a slave. Later he was falsely condemned to spend his years in prison (death). God allowed Joseph to interpret the dreams of the butler and baker and later the king, whereupon, he was made a ruler in the land (fulfillment).

Diplomatic efforts have so far brought no result, but U.N. envoy Kofi Annan told the Security Council in a briefing Friday that he was determined to continue his mission and would return to Damascus.

The removable bottoms are great for keeping the nest boxes clean, and are actually quite durable. Homemade is great and saves money, but if you have ever had to scoop out some of the stuff that accumulates in nests, you know what I am talking about, broken eggs, chicken crap, add a little heat on a hot summer day, and it’s enough to make you urp right there. This type of nest box would be indispensable too, if you get some kind of pest infestation on your chickens. Pests can hide in every nook and cranny. I can pick up that nest box and carry it outside on my hip, remove the bedding, take out the bottoms and give the entire shebang a deep cleaning. That is impossible to do with a fixed wooden nest box scenario. But, a free ranging chicken lives forever, never craps in the nest or breaks an egg and probably is pest free too, so maybe this last paragraph was a sale’s pitch for free-ranging chickens, I don’t know… .

"Consumer-technology products," he declares in the opening essay, originally delivered at Kenyon College's 2011 commencement, "are … great enablers of narcissism. Alongside their built-in eagerness to be liked is a built-in eagerness to reflect well on us. Our lives look a lot more interesting when they're filtered through the sexy Facebook interface." Think about this in relation to the Wallace piece and what emerges is a larger argument about depth and superficiality and the difficulty of having feelings, issues that inform Franzen's fiction as well.

Scientists measured and assessed the circulating amino acids and acylcarnitines in the blood of subjects -- animal studies have suggested they might be related to insulin resistance. (Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins; acylcarnitines are fatty acids that have bound to carnitine" href="http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Carnitine-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank">carnitine). And indeed they found a significant decrease in “branched chain” amino acids within one month among the patients who had weight-loss surgery. But even after two months, the patients on dietary intervention had very little or no change in branched-chain amino acids.

Koblin was feeling equally constrained by digital media.

Once out of school, Vacher joined the military where he was known as a loner, and was thought to be "brutally severe" with new recruits, in part due to his violent temper. Vacher's murderous rage first became known to the authorities in 1893 when he shot the object of his affection, a young maidservant named Louise Barrant, four times because she laughed at him when he proposed marriage. After attempting to murder her because she did not return his affections, Joseph Vacher turned the gun on himself, attempting suicide by shooting himself in the head. Miraculously, both Louise and Joseph survived their injuries. Vacher was left permanently scarred, and partially paralyzed on one side of his face. A bullet remained lodged in his skull, and he may have suffered some brain damage as a result of his suicide attempt. After this incident, Joseph was sent to Saint Robert Asylum in Dole, France - but he was released after one year with the doctors claiming that he had been "cured of his violent persecution mania". The New York Times reported that the physicians actually released him because, "they were afraid of an outcry in the press against the arbitrary confinement of a citizen under the pretext that he was insane." The Times went on to say, "the physicians were well aware that he was not in a condition to be at large."

Mark said that it was all well and good to complain about the state of the world but the book doesn't provide any answer (not that he'd read it), and then we had a skirmish about whether or not novels need to provide answers, which Mark insisted they do. Some people referred to fact that the trio finally go off to Mexico with the notion of starting a hotel, and Mark's derision quadrupled: another kind of running away!! And in order to run a hotel, he objected, wouldn't they end up needing the very structures (accountants etc) they were supposed to despise?! People told him, no it's not that kind of hotel, the characters say they wouldn't charge for rooms: it's just a kind of idealistic dream really; and Mark's derision went through the roof. Backed by John, I said, yes, it's flakey, but that's the point: the book is about the fact that if you can't face the structures society endorses - you're unsuited to them or you disapprove of them - then there aren't really any other very viable options. John brought in the question of the situation for artists, which I thought confused the issue, but Jo, who up to this point had been a detractor, took up his point and agreed that there are certain jobs in our society that are rewarded and others, including artistic endeavour, that tend not to be. To some extent this did back up my point, but, I said, the characters here are not artists, and so don't even have the compensation of artistic fulfilment. Having rejected the endorsed structures they have nothing (just that 'silence'). I said, surely that's a legitimate subject for a novel - ie the fact that there aren't any answers - and several people agreed. Mark said, well, in any case the characters were unlikeable, and now we had that other old skirmish about whether or not you need to find characters likeable in order to like a novel, Mark insisting - I'm damn sure for the sake of argument! - that you did, until John brought in Jane Austen and Vanity Fair with their unlikeable but endlessly interesting characters. But then Clare said that she simply hadn't found these characters or their situation, or indeed the book, interesting.
The Victorian Head Post Office (built 1875) is no longer used as such. It stands on a huge site, some of which is now used as a car park. At the far end is another smaller building bearing on its guttering the date 1907. Developers are no doubt itching to get their hands on the site but the above building is protected by a Grade II listing. The Edwardian building, however, may not survive as the listing describes it as being “of little interest”.

I compare that to the movie business. In the real world, Steven Spielberg can direct only one movie a year.

That's why the book Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus makes reference to the fact that men are from Mars.

This appetite for personal data reflects a fundamental truth about Facebook and, by extension, the Internet economy as a whole: Facebook provides a free service that users pay for, in effect, by providing details about their lives, friendships, interests and activities. Facebook, in turn, uses that trove of information to attract advertisers, app makers and other business opportunities.

No, not necessarily the little things, even the big things bothered me. I hate the idea that John Cena berates Alberto Del Rio, like he is nothing. How do you put over a new guy by continuing to slam him, saying he isn’t in his league, and he is a coward? I get it, Del Rio runs away, but damn, at least give him some mic time to defend himself, tell Cena he will prove him wrong this Sunday.

New construction increases property values and adds housing and job capacity so the region doesn't have to expand its urban growth boundary onto farmland. But unlike the downtown streetcar, with stops along city blocks ripe for redevelopment, this project really offers only bookend opportunities in Lake Oswego and Portland's South Waterfront and Johns Landing areas.

Well after school on Mondays he also has speech. She comes to the house and is here when he gets home. He gives her a hard time every week unless she is doing something he wants to do. He does this great thing where he pretends that he is falling asleep and tells her " My meds make me sleepy" Ummm ya. Nice try buddy. Your meds haven't med you sleepy in months, and they don't make you tired Tuesday thru Sunday. So natural consequence... In life if you are tired and falling asleep you go to bed. So I sent him to go lay down. The raging fit that followed that was ginormous. He was screaming at me that he wasn't tired for what seemed like hours. But I stood my ground and finally he gave up. Speech came Tuesday too for a make up day, and he was much better and not tired at all!!! LOL

"What's wrong with the franchise is we're not winning," he said. "If we were winning, we'd all be happy. So what it comes down to is the product on the field, and there are a lot of ways to go at it. ... When we acquired the Nuggets, we were abysmal. I would say they were certainly pretty bad. (But) I think we've brought them along (the Nuggets have not had a losing season since 2002, while reaching the playoffs eight consecutive seasons), and the way we did that was we concentrated on the personnel. We got a head coach (George Karl) we could trust and had the intelligence and energy and the track record, quite frankly. He'd proven he could do it. So once we got all that in place, we got a lot better.

"I learned a lot by talking to John about adjusting my investment strategy based on my age and where I'm at in life," Hewitt said.

If the stims aren't harmful, aren't self-injurious, then we ought to be careful in whether we address it. Chewing hair, like my Rosie does, is potentially a life-threatening behavior--so her hair is short. She sucks on clothes--potentially harmful, so we got her a chewelry necklace for her need to suck and chew on things. It isn't about shaming her or changing her, but redirecting her self-regulatory behaviors to something that will be soothing without being harmful.

He highlighted Chongqing's economic performance and his attempts to use the power of the state to build a more egalitarian society—an approach opposed by liberals who favor Wang Yang's efforts to foster reforms in Guangdong. But unlike his many public appearances last year, Mr. Bo made only one brief reference to his own controversial campaigns to encourage residents to sing Maoistrevolutionary songs and to force local officials and students to work stints in the countryside.

The public, on the other hand, can be easy to impress – at least in the short term. The media eagerly gives celebrity status to anyone who happens to catch the public’s attention, for good or for ill, but today’s media darling is frequently tomorrow’s goat. Like it or not, the media and the public have recently put the spotlinght on us, and want to make Naval Special Warriors into today’s celebrities – war heroes to look up to – and they want to make every guy who has gone through our training a steely-eyed war-hero, epitomizing all that is good in the American male.

Today is Safer Internet Day, with a focus this year on learning to be safe online together, intergenerationally. I think this is a great focus as I think often some of the 'be safe online' advice that we are encouraged to give to the young is too broad and basic, and starts from too scared a position. It's like the standard 'stranger danger' advice given to primary age children that makes me more than a little nervous. Kids are, statistically, more at risk from people known to them than strangers, and many younger kids are led to believe that greeting neighbours (whom you see often but don't 'know' in any real sense) is dangerous or somehow bad.
My excuse is that I’ve been out of the classroom (except for the workshops I give at conferences etc.) for a good ten-plus years.

Because: it trumps, realigns and amiably ushers gay filmmaking forward - and it looks and feels effortless in doing so. (Yes, it is universal, but it is also certified Gay Cinema - its level of success means it manages a multitude of things to a great many different types of people.) The two well-written, and entirely real, characters at the centre of this big-hearted compact-romance have hardly, if ever, been explored in this way. (More on Weekend here - mini comments, along with some thoughts on Pariah.)
Contrary to what women generally say about men, I remember my granddad pulling into a gas station plenty of times to ask for directions and not only receiving them but also walking out with a free map to boot. These days only people with little commonsense or a huge self-destructive streak would ask anyone in modern convenience stores directions to anything other than the filthy, and usually broken bathroom they offer the public. For me though, the one service I found myself missing this morning were the once free to everyone air pumps.

Inspecting the six distinct layers of tissue that make up a woman's vaginal wall, Ostrzenski said, he uncovered small, grape-like clusters of erectile tissue housed in a sac less than 1 centimeter across - "a deep, deep structure" nestled between the vaginal wall's fifth layer, the endopelvic fascia, and its sixth, the dorsal perineal membrane.

Meghan suggested doing our swap in person, and after a couple busy work weeks, we finally carved out some time on Monday to meet up at Starbucks to swap our little mugs!

So far, Spider-Man has acclimated to being a part of our diverse animal family, as well as being a part of the family in general. He may nip a tad, but he has (yet) to actually bite us. Although, he takes pleasure in pooping on ME any time that he can get it seems. And he loves running on his wheel (hence why there is an old pillow we don’t use any longer UNDER his cage, as to stifle the horrid sounds of his use of the wheel from vibrating all the way down to my bedroom in the basement) and cuddling with us human family members.
Apparently, it doesn't end there.
"For 100 years, the Chamber has been recognizing those individuals and companies that give back to the community," Cordes said.

It's been a couple of hours now and Ross is still at the intervention. Sometimes I think forcing our friend to get help, like, physically dragging him into a treatment center and all but strapping him down (Ross actually did that with him once) is the answer. He's staying with another friend right now, in an arrangement that's about to end. And then? We don't know. We remind ourselves not to be fatalistic, but we also say: "He could be homeless, he could die; these are his choices if he opts not to get help."
Councilman Lamar Willis, an ARC member, said he isn’t complaining. Full funding would be a quarter of the sales tax’s draw for regional projects, he said. The balance could be raised with hotel/motel taxes or other sources.

Last week Charlie Gilmour, son of writer and photographer Polly Samson and stepson of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, was jailed for sixteen months for violent disorder. He was strung out on booze, drugs and lack of sleep and misbehaved significantly on the student protest against spending cuts in central London last December. Nobody, himself included, denied that he had been a Very Naughty (and Silly) Boy. There was a financial value to the damage he did, although the extent of that damage remains open to debate. He was seen to kick, but not break, a window and deemed to have thrown a bin at the car carrying Charlie Windsor and his missus. He had earlier swung himself on the Cenotaph flag. All in all, not a good day. I'm sure he wasn't too surprised to find himself in court. He issued an apology pretty much as soon as he'd had a chance to sober up, but having had his collar felt, must have expected that matters would be taken further as indeed they were.
But we managed to get those older fans without losing the kids. That was a real thrill for me.

The Maryland attorney general's office fought the ruling, but had to put its own appeal on hold for more than a year to see how the country's high court would decide two similar cases involving botched plea offers. The justices' decisions, each reached in a 5-4 vote, seem to side with Merzbacher's interpretation.

Mix together eggs, applesauce, oil, sugars and vanilla. Add and mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Next mix in the carrots.
Both the mousse and ice cream use a technique known as tempering to gradually raise the temperature of a cold mixture to keep eggs in the mixture from curdling. To temper, add about a third of a cold mixture containing eggs to the hot mixture while stirring, then add the hot mixture to the cold, also while stirring.

We are longtime Maryland residents, and we're usually law-abiding citizens. Our resumes include Sunday school teaching, Little League baseball coaching, an Eagle Scout award, and leadership roles at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But what's happening at the White House right now is so pivotal to the future of our state and our nation that we decided to take an unusual step: We got arrested. Peacefully, outside the White House lawn over the weekend, we sat down with dozens of other protesters until police led us away in handcuffs, while a crowd of spectators from Maryland, D.C. and beyond chanted, "Wind mills, not oil spills!"

Burress and Mason both suited up for this afternoon’s practice and participated in team drills. Burress took part in three plays, the target of one pass from Sanchez that was tipped. Mason caught the first pass in 11-on-11s, out of the slot, but later admitted that his legs “started to go a little bit in the middle of practice” — so he needs a few more sessions to get up to speed.

Also, it's easier on us to ride them because of this reason. Those big heavy thick spines that horses (and similar animals) have don't have a lot of flexibility. When you look at a horse running, the spines stays relatively level and straight. That makes for a much smoother and comfier ride for the passenger.

Viso: Having made such a strong commitment to the Merce Cunningham archive, we're continuing to build on that. We recently bought an installation by Meredith Monk, another artist from the Cunningham arena, and drawings by Trisha Brown. So we're starting to make acquisitions that are more interdisciplinary. It's part of our five-year plan and includes filmmakers as well. It's part of expanding the global connection to international artists. Our exhibitions also focus and shape where we're going. We have support of a Mellon Foundation grant to understand what it means to have textiles to document, store and archive. That's a challenge.

The other point mentioned in the video was that children used to be 'seen and not heard' but nowadays they are 'embraced, encouraged and praised' every day. This is something that I was thinking about just last week. The whole idea of family has changed and is now centered around the children. Children are looked on as the future and people encourage them/us to reach great heights, do the very best we can and fight for our place at the top. There is a new series on the BBC about The British Family and how things have changed from then to now. I didn't see the whole of the episode on children but it was along the same lines of children coming to dominate and be central to family life. It is still on BBC iPlayer until the 11th Feb.
Conservatives from Burke through Disraeli and Hayek to Reagan have of course always trusted the people as a whole to come up with better decisions than elites do. Burke looked to the wisdom of the people of both the past and present combined; Disraeli saw the ordinary people of England as "angels in marble" and Hayek saw the information available to the population as a whole as infinitely superior to any other information source.

Next Week:A Tale of Two Parties
Good Morning everyone. I'm home!!!! Vacation was awesome. We were very very fortunate to have been in a place that had snow. Oh it was just like a winter wonderland. Lake Placid NY is absolutely gorgeous. We were able to go snowmobile and tubing, Sean and Richard went skiing on the beautiful White Face Mountain while Sharlene and I stayed safely in the lodge. They also went skating on Mirror Lake which is another sport I could never do so I wandered around on the ice with my hockey stick while Sean shot pucks at me. Hmmm?? Was that even safe? I did take a tumble trying to be cool hitting the hockey puck back to him like I knew what I was doing. haha We walked the quaint little town poking around in the shops, visited this huge ice castle and saw the Olympic High Jump. We were not able to do the luge or bobsled ride as the compound was occupied with athletes training for the winter Olympics. Lake Place was home of the winter Olympic Games held in 1932 and again in 1980. It was an amazing feeling being where such an event was held.

I'm wondering who put it together and why. It can't have been an early, rejected attempt at a "White Album" cover -- the Beatles would never have commissioned something so cheesy by 1968. Still, it's amusing... and interesting for the track list. What if the "White Album" had been a single, not a double, album? According to this cover image, the line-up would have eliminated the more idiosyncratic songs (which surely would have ended up later on solo albums).
H-Yes.

The cons include loosing a lot of my curiosity for many things in life, having my love of reading and writing almost completely squashed, having mean and disrespectful teachers, experiencing an invasion of privacy, and—something I’ve been recently noticing about my body compared to my brother’s—not getting the sufficient amount of sleep needed for a growing boy.
Many people who voted Tory in the 1980s were anti-Establishment and “saw part of the left as well as the right running that Establishment”. With a swipe at Oxbridge, the law, outdated parliamentary practice and a divided education system – of all of which he is a product – he complained that many Thatcherites had not wanted to bust, but to “buy out” the old regime.
"I can't have people on committees who are unwilling to talk to me," he said. "That's it in a nutshell. What this simply comes down to is people trying to justify their own bad behavior."
A few suggestions I thought were very interesting. One person said that when their characters aren't cooperating, she tells them they are going to Disneyworld. And when the charters say, WTF, they end up taking her by the hand and leading her where they need to go.

Goodbye hair. Hello mohawk.
With its Pacific Northwest setting, murky lighting and plentiful rain, "Chronicle" plays like an extended episode of "The X-Files" might; DeHaan in particular comes off like one of the series' more-memorable characters. That's a compliment. It isn't a great movie, but one could imagine -- and hope -- that it becomes a cult favorite, outlasting other films of its ilk.
I might sound pompous but that's probably because he's one of my favorite players so I tend to get very subjective about him. In any case the compilation that I'm sharing is (as the title suggests) a bunch of songs he recorded in his "late"career. At those times ragtime (or hot jazz) was starting to settle down for a more orchestrated and organized way of playing - swing so what you get here is an interesting middle ground between the two types of jazz. Musically speaking this means that songs are much more relaxed, they swing but they still have some great improvised solos which makes this record so great. You'll notice a lot things that are way ahead of their times, especially the sax solos which often hint to the bebop way of playing. They are all instrumentals so we can fully enjoy the wondrous playing of a person that just had so little luck. So sit back and enjoy the swing.

More on Rucker: Former Bengals defensive end Frostee Rucker, who agreed to terms with the Browns on Wednesday, was a third-round pick of the Bengals out of Southern Cal in 2006. In 2011, he started the final 11 games for the Bengals, making 44 tackles and four sacks. He split reps in those games with Michael Johnson, who is expected to take over the Bengals' starting job.

* Nick and Juliette -- Least Communicative Couple Ever?: Last week, we saw Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) say no to Nick's marriage proposal. She loves him, but can't marry him until he opens up about what's been going on with him. This week, there seem to be no apparent ripples from this uncomfortable revelation, other than a brief mention by Nick that he and Juliette are having some kind of issue.

I know that this restricted female life was the reality for the time, and certainly not restricted to this book; however, it's something that I noticed much more here than in the other Austen novels I've read in recent years. I am (as someone recently mentioned...) more in my comfort zone in the later Victorian era, and one reason for that is the extended palette the writers use. After wandering through the vast Dickensian and Trollopian expanses of London, being stuck sewing in a cramped cottage seems a little tame by comparison...

I spent last Thursday through Saturday in New York attending the CMJ Music Marathon. It’s basically New York’s version of South by Southwest. It’s more geared toward unsigned and lesser known bands. We saw 15 bands over the three days in Brooklyn and Manhattan. It was a whirlwind of music. At CMJ, every artist/band plays a 30 minute set. I actually liked the format because it allows one to see a lot of bands in one showcase. Heading into the festival, I thought it was going to be hipster music overload, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was quite a diverse and unique musical landscape across the three days. The highlights of the festival for me included:
Never knew Catch Phrase could get so heated!
That's my job to enhance our talents given abilities. Great Work!
Next came time for the demonstration of making chocolate using the traditional tools. The Mano and Metate are used to grind the fermented, roasted partially ground cacao beans into a chocolate paste. These tools can be compared to a mortar and pestle in function. The form is different as the metate is a horizontal tray upon which, through a specific technique, the beans and nibs are crushed to make the chocolate paste. At Cyrila’s Farm the mano and metate is made from basalt, a volcanic stone material that has been handed down through the generations.

Authorities spoke to Mutrie a short time after the shooting from outside the home but things soon went silent, he said. Around 2 a.m., a tactical team placed a robot equipped a video camera in the home, which detected the bodies. Authorities are still trying to determine when Mutrie and the woman died, but Delaney said they both died of gunshot wounds in either a murder-suicide or double suicide.

Fortunately for all of us, Muramasa is also a lot of fun. While I do spend a lot of time taking in the backgrounds and animation, this is largely due to how responsive the controls are and how well they do what they need to; I never need to fight with the controls to do what I want them to, so I’m afforded the luxury of enjoying the details. As a seasoned veteran of 2D sidescrollers, I’ve played my fair share of excellent action games, and this is one of them. While the game can be difficult at times, I have never died because the game was being cheap or artificially inflating the difficulty. All of the tools to do well in the game are explained in a tutorial at the beginning of the game, and after a few hours of play it becomes clear that all of them are necessary to do well in Muramasa. Since I consider myself fairly talented at action games, particularly beat ‘em up action games, I went for the harder of the two difficulties right away. The higher difficulty level forced me to learn the combat system and not button mash my way through, which I’m fairly certain I would be able to do on the lower difficulty. However, if it had gotten too difficult at any time I could have changed the difficulty part way through the game, which is a nice feature.

Yesterday was not quite that interesting for me but had increasing levels of unexpectedness. My blog yesterday morning was titled Guess The Name of the Comedian and the clue was that the un-named comic “does just sometimes use prostitutes. Mostly in Soho”. Interestingly, two other comedians suggested the self-same name to me. But they were wrong. This other now-famous TV comic whom they named clearly needs to do something about his image among his peers.

The bottom portion of my card uses the "Ticking Stripe" background stamp, stamping onto blue cardstock with Memento Danube Blue ink.

To create my butterfly, I used Spellbinders Butterflies die, diecut 2 different cardstock colors and then added popdots between each to give the butterfly some dimension.
With Ruby gone, the Los Angeles Zoo was left with one elephant, a 21-year-old Asian bull named Billy. In late 2010, he moved into a staunchly debated, court-contested, $42 million, $3.8-acre "Elephants of Asia" habitat at the zoo.

Generally speaking, my family and friends have grown to appreciate (or at the very least, accept) my tattoos.

4) Out of every guy I have ever dated, there’s not one I would jump out of a life boat for. It just seems insane and one of the moments I just look at Rose with serious judgement. Don’t get me wrong, I’m jealous of that old couple clutching to one and other as water comes pouring into their room. They seem at peace and very much in love. I would much rather do that than bobbing in the ocean freezing my ass off and trying to comfort women who left their men behind.

My sister has a foot phobia. I don’t mean like a slight aversion to feet. I mean that she is actually afraid of them and actively avoids them in all situations. She wears socks…all the time. I went to the movies with her the other day (it’s the middle of summer) and she quickly threw off her thongs & proceeded to put on some socks. I’ve asked her why she hates them so much…she says she can’t explain, but the sight of feet make her feel sick.

A: The Columbia Generating Station, the Northwest's only nuclear power reactor, was built 15 years after the Japanese reactors and unlike them includes a system that can keep cooling the reactor core even after a total loss of power. When the tsunami knocked out backup generators in Japan, the reactor cooling system failed, causing the disastrous overheating of fuel. If electricity fails at the Columbia Generating Station, workers can run the cooling system on steam power. The plant also has three backup diesel generators, each with enough fuel to produce electricity for seven days, said Mike Paoli, a spokesman for Energy Northwest, the company that runs the reactor. If all three generators fail, Paoli said, the plant has battery backup that can maintain cooling for 8 hours at a stretch, between rechargings by a portable diesel generator.

Elspeth is woken by the door of her room crashing open, and having a girl younger then herself try to tell her that she is here to ‘warn her’, but it is obvious that the poor girl cannot ‘think straight’ and has trouble expressing her thoughts. She has obviously had some sort of trauma or mental illness, judging by her erratic behaviour. Using her mental abilities, Elspeth was able to connect with the girl’s mind and found out her name was Selmar. Elspeth could tell that her mind was basically destroyed, from some incident, which makes me wonder what happened to her. The scene is made worse with the arrival of a ‘girlish’ young boy, who seems to torment and ridicule Selmar, whose reaction to his arrival is one of fear. He acts like he has authority, when he is probably only 11 or 12. He is a devilish, cunning and malicious boy. He is someone I will have no trouble hating.

"While it is hard to judge an animal's happiness, we believe that if an animal is able to act out its natural instincts while it is alive that it is happy. This is why all the animals we sell live outdoors as nature intended and maintains a natural diet. Every product we sell comes with a traceable label that allows our customers to verify our claims for themselves."The downside is that they are frozen, not fresh, but I bought one all the same. It was just over $12 for a very small bird.

CEOs can be a cautious breed. Why make yourself a target? Then there's Aubrey McClendon, the CEO of Chesapeake Energy, a driving force behind America's natural gas revolution, a bumptious voice in energy and environmental politics, scourge of the coal industry turned scourge of his former green allies, and lately the target of corporate-governance scrutiny for loans he took from a firm that was also negotiating to buy assets from Chesapeake.

San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón charged the sheriff with three misdemeanor counts: domestic violence, child endangerment and dissuading a witness. To my mind, Gascón should have dropped the charges. Grabbing your wife's arm and bruising her does not constitute domestic violence - especially when the wife never pressed charges and denied that her husband abused her. The child endangerment count was ludicrous - based on the fact that the couple's son was in the car during the fateful fight. Ditto the dissuading-a-witness charge - because Mirkarimi allegedly tried to stifle Lopez.

We are having some amazingly mild weather lately, and from what I've been reading, so has a lot of the country. I'd say many of us are due some mild weather after a year of real extremes. I've been seeing posts and hearing people talking about some of the plants that are already showing buds or making their way up through the soil. As much as I love seeing those signs of spring I'm a little nervous that we could and probably will get some really cold weather. Some plants will be fine either way, but there are some that might not be.

If we’re going to point our kids to Jesus as the Savior of sinners, then it’s not enough to simply have regular family devotions (or family worship). Certainly those times are extremely important, but as believing parents, we need to create an environment of gospel-telling, and that doesn’t happen with just 15-20 minutes in the Word with them a few times a week. It happens when we combine family worship with the discipline of connecting everyday moments to the cross.

Of course we all know Danny’s onto a winner with his WMPC project, he gets his dinner cooked by some of London’s finest food bloggers (and a few hangers on like me) and he buys them cheap lunch or gives them a bottle of plonk. This guy’s no fool. And of course he claims he’s proved his own cooking credentials before with his rWMPC swap with Essex Eating. But I’m not buying that. I mean they are both called Dan, they are both from Essex, they pretend to go to the same events, they tweet from the same train home, and to my knowledge they’ve never been seen in the same room at the same time. So you know, I think they are the same person, its obvious, well maybe at very least related in some way that means Dan 2 isn’t going to say Dan 1 can’t cook and vice versa…..I’m suspicious and so I coolly volunteer to be rWMPC participant number 2. Danny is rather evasive and it takes me quite a number of months to finally pin him to a date….is this because after all he can’t actually cook I wonder.
The story of Ireland’s bailout in November 2010 has been partly told in dribs and drabs. Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Patrick Honohan said that the Minister for Finance in November 2010, the late Brian Lenihan was “crestfallen” when he learned from the ECB that Ireland couldn’t default even on the unguaranteed debts of the banks. The Governor went on to say that Minister Lenihan was “offered no room” for negotiation on the matter. And in April 2011, Dan O’Brien in a BBC Radio 4 programme referred to a letter sent by the former ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet on Friday 19th November to Minister Lenihan which set out the ECB position, and which implicitly made demands on Ireland in respect of repaying bondholders as a quid pro quo for the ingoing provision of liquidity to Irish banks – remember to this day, the ECB provides €150bn-odd to Irish banks in loans secured by assets in the banks; the ECB does the same with banks in other countries.

I attended a lecture at the Fermi Lab in Batavia last Friday, called “Sleights of Mind.” The researchers, Stephen Macknik and Susana Martinez-Conde, talked about how and why we are taken in by magic. The brain, it turns out, cannot multi-task. It can only focus on one thing at a time, which is why misdirection, the fundamental trick in sleight of hand, works. Visual information is so complex for the brain to process that it takes 18% of the cerebral cortex to do the work, in the lump at the back called the Occipital Lobe. Your eyes can only focus on one thing at a time, which is why we keep shifting our gaze if we want to take in a larger scene. If we didn’t have to shift, i.e. if we could put our peripheral vision also into focus, the brain would have to be 500 times bigger than it is.

Really, though, a lot of the genius is in the casting - Robert Downey Jr. may be approaching middle age, but he hasn't lost a bit of his energy. It's simply delightful to see him sink into the character of Tony Stark, which seems tailor-made for him. In fact, it's great just to see Downey working again, and at the top of his game. I thought he was a bizarre choice for an action hero when I first learned of the project, but I'm perfectly happy to be proven wrong here.

All the previous missionaries had died or left.

The author starts off his introduction revealing the theme of Philippians as being joy. This gives me a good impression about Paul’s Letter to the Philippians. It tells the reader that the writer of this epistle was a person who will hope-filled rather than one who was burdened down with suffering. Suffering in the midst of hope and joy is what the suffering church needs to hear—even today.

But they're straight without being skinny and the right shade of blue and most important, they won't fall down minutes after I put them on.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Treasury is delaying a decision on whether to start borrowing in an unconventional way to help cover the federal budget deficits: By offering Treasurys with variable interest rates, like those on some home mortgages.
Got drum corp tomorrow and i lost my sticks.. sorry Mr.Berry!! Please no pushups!!
Just raising the figure isn’t sufficient, so long as there are corporate slaveholders like Walmart who make everyone “casual” employees. Even when the baboons in Washington rouse themselves to belatedly raise the minimum wage, they stupidly enter a fixed figure in the bill, which quickly falls behind inflation. Under our plan, we will create a minimum wage law that sets the wage as a variable linked to inflation, price indexes, etc. Presto! No need to ever pass another bill!
